## Special Accomplishments

A few accomplishments that I feel especially proud of:
* Becoming a DjangoCon US Website Maintainer and Pinax Release Manager
* Participating in Stanford Code in Place
* Representing DEFNA at PyCon Charlas, international outreach

> **“Finishing up a new Pinax release that drops support for Python 2.7 in 25+ apps and improves our community docs, among other things. Big milestone for me because I managed the end-to-end process... created the release plan, oversaw the work, merged the PRs, tagged & published.🎉”**<br>
