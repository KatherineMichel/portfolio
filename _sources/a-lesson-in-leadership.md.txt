# A Lesson in Leadership

Last week at work, a leadership team was in town and answering employee questions at a fireside chat. 

The event was an extension of a quarterly meetup I helped launch a couple years ago. 

During the event, I marveled at how impressive the general manager overseeing a division was... his communication skills, knowledge of his domain, and sense of humor. 

Afterward, I hung around meeting people. 

All of a sudden, the general manager appeared in front of me. I was very surprised. I'd never met him before and had no idea that he knew of me. 

He knew my name and thanked me for all that I do, then chatted with me about my work. 

Imagine having someone in a significant position of leadership unexpectedly notice you and appreciate your effort. He didn't have to do it, and it left me on cloud nine. 

It goes beyond management to the inspiration of leadership. 

Who could you notice and thank this coming week? It might make their day.
