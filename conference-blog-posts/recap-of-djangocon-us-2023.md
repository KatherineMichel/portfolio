# Recap of DjangoCon US 2023

## Intro

DjangoCon US 2023 took place from October 16-20 in Durham, North Carolina. It was the sixth DjangoCon US I've had the privilege of attending, and in my opinion, the best one yet. 

"This makes me smile. ❤️ We are nowhere near where we want to be on diversity, but making big strides. I think this was the most fun DjangoCon US I've been to so far, and the growing diversity played a big part in that."

## Saturday

Things got off to a great start with a DEFNA Board dinner at [Parizade](https://www.parizadedurham.com/menus/) on Saturday night. 

According to every person I spoke to who had eaten there before, you can't go wrong. Everything is so good. I'd never eaten linguini and clams before, but it sounded really good. I decided to be adventurous and try it. If you won't do something new on the eve of DjangoCon US, when will you? I chose well.  

It was a rare opportunity to spend time in person with other board members and enjoy a perfect meal. 

Amazing ambiance

"Thank you to our DEFNA President Peter Grandstaff and Two Rock Software for treating fellow DEFNA Board Members in Durham for DjangoCon US to a magical dinner last night at Parizade. The apple pie mezcal margarita, linguini and clams, cookie and ice cream dessert, and company were stellar."

## Sunday

I love a good cup of coffee. On Sunday, I ventured to nearby [Cocoa Cinnamon](https://littlewaves.coffee/pages/old-north-durham) coffee shop. I had a Dr. Durham Latte ([organizer recommended](https://2023.djangocon.us/venue/#places)).

![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/cocoa-cinnamon-dr-durham.jpg)

It was comically on brand that with coffee in hand, I was looking for the [Durham Convention Center](https://www.durhamconventioncenter.com/) to help with organizing, got lost, and serendipitously stumbled upon the [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/durham/) Workshop hosted at the office of our wonderful, longtime partners [Caktus Group](https://www.caktusgroup.com/). I was reunited with my friends Dawn Wages, Jay Miller, Jason Judkins, Rebecca Conway, and Tim Allen. It was a great time at an event where lives are changed. The event featured a majority of black participants! While at the workshop, I enjoyed food from [Neomonde Mediterranean](https://www.neomonde.com/mediterranean-restaurant-durham/) ([organizer recommended](https://2023.djangocon.us/venue/#places)), caught up with my friends, and picked up some swag! 

So good to be welcomed in by my friend Tim :)

I've always wanted one of these shirts! 
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/django-girls-shirts.jpg)

I eventually made it to the Durham Convention Center for swag stuffing! Many hands make light work. A wonderful conference partner [Discover Durham](https://www.discoverdurham.com/) also generously provided city guides for swag bags and gift boxes by [City Box Durham](https://cityboxdurham.com/) for organizers and speakers.

Later that night, I attended Django Social at [Ponysaurus](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/taproom). The event was hosted by Jason Judkins, DjangoCon US Organizer, and Jon Gould of [Foxley Talent](https://foxleytalent.com/about/), DjangoCon US Sponsors. 

Jon and company have started a network of Django meetups in the UK called Django Social. Jason is starting a [Raleigh-Durham chapter](https://www.meetup.com/djangosocial-raleighdurham/) and this was the kickoff. 

Not being a fan of beer, I had a Ponysaurus signature [Beer Cocktail](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/taproom-menu) called a Gosé Margarita (lime juice, triple sec, & tequila, topped with Gosé beer). 

Gosé Margarita 
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/ponysaurus-beer-cocktail.jpg)

During the event, I happened to find myself having a conversation with a woman who really knew a lot about open source and events! It turned out to be the new [Python Software Foundation Executive Director Deb Nicholson](https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/). Serendity strikes again. I love it when that happens. :) She was accessible throughout the conference, and it was a wonderful place to get to know her. Check out her Monday talk about meetups.

I enjoyed meeting and getting to know the new Python Software Foundation Executive Director Deb Nicholson, spending time with two of my favorite Python/Django authors Eric Matthes and William Vincent, and catching up with my wonderful Revsys friends Frank and Jeff, among many interesting conversations."

## Monday

On Monday, I ate breakfast with our new [Django Fellow Natalia Bidart](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/mar/31/welcome-our-new-fellow-natalia-bidart/). I was thrilled to meet her! We talked about our work, what her experience has been like so far as a Django Fellow, and she introduced me to the art of drinking [maté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)).

Kojo Idressa kicked of the conference with the the kind of [Orientation and Welcome](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/orientation-and-welcome/) that only he can deliver. 

Kojo on stage- sorry for the fuzzy pic, Kojo! 
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/kojo.jpg)

Thank you Kojo for setting the stage for a wonderful conference. 

“All of you are beyond welcome and we are thrilled you are here.”
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/kojo-welcome.png)

Kojo also educated the audience about the concept of a Self Care Sprint. It's important to take time for yourself, as needed. 

Self Care Sprint
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/self-care-sprint.jpg)

During the Opening Remarks, Peter Grandstaff asked everyone to be kind and make this conference a great place for everyone else. "If you see someone engaging in inappropriate behavior, here's a phrase you can use, 'Hey, we don't do that here.'"

A powerful tool borrowed from PyCon Australia and written about by Eric Holscher of [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/) and [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) for setting norms: "[Hey, we don't do that here.](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2023/feb/10/we-dont-do-that-here/)"
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/hey-we-dont.jpg)

I don't take the time that Natalie spent on her talk lightly. I've chatted with women recently about the additional overhead women and other underrepresented people often have from doing extra work to change the system. It can be exhausting.

After conference activities, as usual, hanging around in the lobby led to a great adventure. Hanging around in a lobby once led to me sitting next to Guido at an impromptu group dinner and chatting with him about the early days of Python. 

On this night, I ended up having dinner with Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Andrew Godwin (Django Core Dev, Django Async Architect, South creator, and the only person who has attended every DjangoCon US), Frank Wiles (Revsys Founder and Partner, and former DSF President), and Tim and and Charles of the Wharton School, my past client.

We ate at a restaurant called [It's a Southern Thing](https://getsouthernfood.com/). The food was high quality and the service was great. I had the Crispy Catfish.

## Sight Seeing and More Food!

I consider getting to know the host city to be an important part of the conference experience. 

### Sight Seeing

After doing a bit of research, I chose the [Sarah P. Duke Gardens](https://gardens.duke.edu/) as my top priority for sight seeing. After spending time there, I can personally report that if you are in Durham, it is an absolute must see. Some of the scenes there were simply stunning! 

<!--

After visiting the gardens, I made the quick walk over to the [Duke Chapel](https://chapel.duke.edu/). Not only was the chapel gorgeous, but the [Conference for North Carolina Chapter of the American Choral Directors Association](https://chapel.duke.edu/events/conference-north-carolina-chapter-american-choral-directors-association-1697169600) was taking place. A choir that must have been made up of elite children singers happened to be practicing. I've stumbled into some jaw-dropping experiences while traveling. This was another one. Together, the music and surroundings were magical. Take a listen. 

<!--

I also visited the [Museum of Life and Science](lifeandscience.org/). The [Butterfly House](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/butterfly-house/) in particular was a really special experience. I was also happy to have a second change to see lemurs. Duke University has the largest population of lemurs in the world outside of Madagascar, but unfortunately, its tours were booked through the rest of the year. The Museum of Life and Science has a [Lemur Exhibit](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/lemurs-and-tortoises/). I enjoyed observing these beautiful animals. [The Farmyard](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/the-farmyard/), [Insectarium](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/insectarium/), and [Aerospace](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/aerospace/) exhibits were also really fun and interesting.

Unfortunately, the [train](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/train/) that takes passengers around the museum's 84 acres was not in operation at the time of my visit. I know I would have really enjoyed it.

### Food

After having read rave reviews about [Loaf](https://www.loafdurham.com/) bakery, I had to pay a visit. It did not disappoint. I ordered a ham and gruyere croissant, a walnut sea salt brownie, a pain au chocolat, and 5 pumpkin chocolate chip cookies.

For dinner one night, I ordered takeaway from [Pizzeria Toro](https://www.pizzeriatoro.com/), right around the corner from the Marriott. I had a mouthwatering red-sauce pizza with shredded mozzarella, black olives, mixed mushrooms, and fennel sausage. 

Cool atmosphere!

Yum! 
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/pizzeria-toro-pizza.jpg)

After having read rave reviews about [Press Coffee, Crepe, and Cocktails](https://pressccc.com/locations/durham/) at the [American Tobacco Campus](https://americantobacco.co/), I simply had to visit. I was keen to have a seasonal Black Forest Latte. I finally had the opportunity on sprint day morning. The atmosphere was bright and cute. The food was excellent. I think this was the first time that I've ever had a savory crepe.

## In Closing

My sixth DjangoCon US
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/badge.jpg)

"As usual, I've tried to squeeze every last bit of experience out of DjangoCon US and have done about as much as I humanly can. 🤣 Today is a day for relaxed sprinting, catching up with a few more people, and flying back to Plano. I'll write up a proper blog post soon with thoughts about talks, the people I met, sightseeing, and food. For the moment, suffice it to say, this conference just gets better every year and that is because of the people. Everyone is welcome and everyone makes it a better place. This community is changing the world for the better through shared humanity and technology. And, it's not a coincidence that it started in wonderful Lawrence, Kansas."
