"Thank you to our DEFNA President Peter Grandstaff and Two Rock Software for treating fellow DEFNA Board Members in Durham for DjangoCon US to a magical dinner last night at Parizade. The apple pie mezcal margarita, linguini and clams, cookie and ice cream dessert, and company were stellar."

It was a rare opportunity to spend time in person with other board members and enjoy some incredible food. 

<!--
I asked several people for recommendations about what to order there. They all said you can't go wrong. Everything is so good. I decided to be adventurous and order something that sounded good, but that I'd never had before: linguini and clams. I chose well. It was one of the most delicious meals that I've ever had.
-->

Amazing ambiance

## Sunday

I love a good cup of coffee. On Sunday, I ventured to nearby [Cocoa Cinnamon](https://littlewaves.coffee/pages/old-north-durham) coffee shop. I had a Dr. Durham Latte ([organizer recommended](https://2023.djangocon.us/venue/#places)).

It was comically on brand that with coffee in hand, I was looking for the Durham Convention Center to help with organizing, got lost, and serendipitously stumbled upon the [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/durham/) Workshop hosted at the office of our wonderful, longtime partners [Caktus Group](https://www.caktusgroup.com/). I was reunited with my friends Dawn Wages, Jay Miller, Jason Judkins, Rebecca Conway, and Tim Allen. It was a great time and lives were changed. Many Django careers have been started through Django Girls. While there, I enjoyed food from [Neomonde Mediterranean](https://www.neomonde.com/mediterranean-restaurant-durham/) ([organizer recommended](https://2023.djangocon.us/venue/#places)), caught up with my friends, and picked up some swag! 

So good to be welcomed in by my friend Tim :)

I eventually made it to the Durham Convention Center for swag stuffing! [Discover Durham](https://www.discoverdurham.com/) also generously provided gift boxes by [City Box Durham](https://cityboxdurham.com/).

Later that night, I attended Django Social at [Ponysaurus](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/taproom). Not being a fan of beer, I had one of their signature [Beer Cocktails](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/taproom-menu) a Gosé Margarita (lime juice, triple sec, & tequila, topped with Gosé beer).

During the event, I happened to find myself having a conversation with a woman who really knew a lot about open source and events! It turned out to be the new [Python Software Foundation Executive Director Deb Nicholson](https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/). Serendity strikes again. I love it when that happens. :) She was accessible throughout the conference, and it was a wonderful place to get to know her. Check out her Monday talk about meetups.

## Monday

On Monday, I ate breakfast with our new [Django Fellow Natalia Bidart](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/mar/31/welcome-our-new-fellow-natalia-bidart/). I was thrilled to meet her! 

Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe delivered the keynote [Finding Purpose in Open Source Through Community Building](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-finding-purpose-in-open-source-through-community-building/). It was inspiring.

Afterward, I had a scoop of chocolate ice cream from [The Parlor](https://theparlour.co/) ([organizer recommended](https://2023.djangocon.us/venue/#places)).

On Monday, I was fortunate to come into the possession of one of [Foxley Talent](https://foxleytalent.com/about/)'s highly coveted Django Social T-shirts. I couldn't resist wearing it on Tuesday. Jon and I took a picture together at the Foxley Talent booth. :)

My friend Andrew "Pandy" Knight delivered the Wednesday morning keynote [Testing Modern Web Apps Like a Champion](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-testing-modern-web-apps-like-a-champion/). Afterward, I had the chance to catch up with him. His talk has rekindled my desire to get better at testing and reminded me of what a great resource Test Automation University is. He gave me a card resource too!

This year, along the lines of my fellow DEFNA board member Jeff Triplett's annual [DjangoCon US Talks I'd Like to See](https://jefftriplett.com/2023/djangocon-us-talks-i-d-like-to-see-2023-edition/) list, I decided to create my own [Talk Topic Ideas List](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/portfolio/blob/master/conference-blog-posts/topic-ideas-djangocon-us-2023.md). Tim Schilling, who has done an incredible job of taking over my former role of DEFNA Corporate Secretary, tooted to Natalia on Fosstodon. 

Ask and you shall receive. 

On Wednesday, Natalia gave the talk [Inside Out: My Journey of Understanding Inclusion](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/inside-out-my-journey-of-understanding-inclusion)

Thank you to Natalia for embracing our community and asking for reflection about an important subject.

I hope she found our conference to be very welcoming in return. We have certainly made progress.

We ate at a restaurant called [It's a Southern Thing](https://getsouthernfood.com/). The food was high quality and the service was great. I had the Crispy Catfish. 

Crispy Catfish ("Crispy cornmeal fried catfish served over a bed of red beans & rice; made with beef sausage, holy trinity, creole spices, finished with a creole mustard aioli")

Afterward, led by Tim, we had ice cream at a novel ice cream shop called [Simon Says Dip This](https://www.simonssaysdipthis.com/). Tim said he's never seen an ice cream shop like this anywhere else.

## Sight Seeing and More Food!

I consider getting to know the host city to be an important part of the conference experience. 

### Sight Seeing

After doing a bit of research, I chose the [Sarah P. Duke Gardens](https://gardens.duke.edu/) as my top priority for sight seeing. After spending time there, I can personally report that if you are in Durham, it is an absolute must see. Some of the scenes there were simply stunning! 

<!--

After visiting the gardens, I made the quick walk over to the [Duke Chapel](https://chapel.duke.edu/). Not only was the chapel gorgeous, but the [Conference for North Carolina Chapter of the American Choral Directors Association](https://chapel.duke.edu/events/conference-north-carolina-chapter-american-choral-directors-association-1697169600) was taking place. A choir that must have been made up of elite children singers happened to be practicing. I've stumbled into some jaw-dropping experiences while traveling. This was another one. Together, the music and surroundings were magical. Take a listen.

I also visited the [Museum of Life and Science](lifeandscience.org/). The [Butterfly House](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/butterfly-house/) in particular was a really special experience. I was also happy to have a second change to see lemurs. Duke University has the largest sanctuary for lemurs in the world, but unfortunately, its tours were booked through the rest of the year. The Museum of Life and Science has a [Lemur Exhibit](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/lemurs-and-tortoises/). I enjoyed observing these beautiful animals. [The Farmyard](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/the-farmyard/), [Insectarium](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/insectarium/), and [Aerospace](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/aerospace/) exhibits were also really fun and interesting.

Unfortunately, the [train](https://www.lifeandscience.org/explore/train/) that takes passengers around the museum's 84 acres was not in operation at the time of my visit. I know I would have really enjoyed it.

### Food

After having read rave reviews about [Loaf](https://www.loafdurham.com/) bakery, I had to pay a visit. It did not disappoint. I ordered a ham and gruyere croissant, a walnut sea salt brownie, a pain au chocolat, and 5 pumpkin chocolate chip cookies.

For dinner one night, I ordered takeaway from [Pizzeria Toro](https://www.pizzeriatoro.com/), right around the corner from the Marriott. I had a mouthwatering red-sauce pizza with shredded mozzarella, black olives, mixed mushrooms, and fennel sausage. 

Cool atmosphere! 
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/pizzeria-toro.jpg)

Yum! 
![](recap-of-djangocon-us-2023-images/pizzeria-toro-pizza.jpg)

After having read rave reviews about [Press Coffee, Crepe, and Cocktails](https://pressccc.com/locations/durham/) at the [American Tobacco Campus](https://americantobacco.co/), I simply had to visit. I was keen to have a seasonal Black Forest Latte. I finally had the opportunity on sprint day morning. The atmosphere was bright and cute. The food was excellent. I think this was the first time that I've ever had a savory crepe.
