<h3>Finding Purpose in Open Source Through Community Building<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-purpose-in-open-source-through-community-building" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe delivered the keynote <a class="reference external" href="https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-finding-purpose-in-open-source-through-community-building/">Finding Purpose in Open Source Through Community Building</a>.</p>
<p>When Abigail was young, she didn‚Äôt like math, science, and computers. Her parents would show her how to do a chore, then leave her to do it herself. She credits them with having taught her how to bring people into open source. That is her purpose in life.</p>
<p>In 2017, after her undergraduate studies, she took part in a Django Girls workshop with DjangoCon US Organizer Noah Alorwu as her mentor. She was encouraged to give back by teaching other women how to code. She went on to be an organizer or mentor at 25 events with 500+ participants in cities and and remote areas of Ghana. She was happy to be the first female mentor, but not satisfied. She encouraged other women to become involved.</p>
<p>Only two years later, at PyCon Africa Django Girls workshop in Ghana, all of the coaches were women. It was a proud moment and a result of that effort.</p>
<p>Abigail told the stories of six people she had met through her open source work. Some were shy or inexperienced. Others were more established. Some were coders, some weren‚Äôt. Some had a passion. Others were trying to figure out where they could fit in. She was able to get to know them and see their potential. Like her parents, she taught them how to do tasks, then left them on their own to grow into leadership and perhaps find themselves in the process. She has been able to ‚Äú10x‚Äù her impact this way.</p>
<p>Abigail talked about some of the challenges faced:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lack of opportunities (especially for junior developers)</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of paid open source work</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of resources</p></li>
<li><p>Travel and visa difficulties</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Abigail missed out on some high profile international speaking opportunities due to visa denials. Being a US grad student has opened doors.</p>
<p>Abigail talked about organizers who have grown the Africa Python/Django community, looked out for her, and pushed her outside of her comfort zone.</p>
<p>She is currently on a journey to become an open source program manager, using all of her lessons learned. Contributing to open source has helped her develop resilience, embrace discomfort, achieve personal growth, and find purpose.</p>
<p>Her organizer resume is impressive: Django Girls, PyLadies Ghana, PyData Ghana, PyLadies Morovia, PyLadies Zambia and other PyLadies communities, PyLadies Global, PyCon Ghana 2018, PyCon Africa, PSF internship, Everything Open Research (a non-profit she started), and DE&amp;I research</p>
<p>She invited the audience to DjangoCon Africa in Zanzibar, Tanzania from November 6-11. Another PyCon Africa is also in the works.</p>
<p>She asked the audience to consider how they are helping bring people into open source, especially people who do not necessarily love coding. She hopes her story will inspire others to give back to their local communities.</p>
<p>Abigail and I have been following each other on social media for quite a while. I was really excited to meet her in person!</p>

<h3>HTML-ivating your Django web app‚Äôs experience with HTMX, AlpineJS, and streaming HTML<a class="headerlink" href="#html-ivating-your-django-web-app-s-experience-with-htmx-alpinejs-and-streaming-html" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Chris May has been a long-time appreciator of the Django community and wants to give back by elevating the experience of your Django app through his talk <a class="reference external" href="https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/html-ivating-your-django-web-app-s-experience-with-htmx-alpinejs-and-streaming-html/">HTML-ivating your Django web app‚Äôs experience with HTMX, AlpineJS, and streaming HTML</a>.</p>
<!--
Chris was once a graphic designer and learned how user experience could drastically transform any project. He fell in love with Python in 2007, and his passion is helping other people enjoy Python and their websites. 
-->
<p>Chris began by talking about the prevalent architectural pattern of SPAs.
<img alt="" src="_images/chris-spas.png" /></p>
<p>Chris believes that better user experience drove their popularity.
<img alt="An initial page load downloads a JavaScript application that handles all interactions and uses APIs to communicate with servers. As the data changes, the page is updated with small payloads without reloading the page. Users enjoy dynamic and engaging interfaces." src="_images/chris-experience-drove-spa-popularity.png" /></p>
<p>But, SPAs have been overused.
<img alt="&quot;SPAs incur complexity that simply doesn't exist with traditional server-based websites: issues such as search engine optimization, browser history management, web analytics and first page load time all need to be addressed. Proper analysis and consideration of the trade-offs is required to determine if that complexity is warranted for business or user experience reasons. Too often teams are skipping that trade-off analysis, blindly accepting the complexity of SPAs by default even when business needs don't justify it. &quot;" src="_images/chris-spa-thoughtworks.png" /></p>
<!--
"We still see some developers who aren't aware of an alternative approach because they've spent their entire career in a framework like React." [Thoughtworks on SPAs](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar/techniques/spa-by-default#:~:text=SPAs%20incur%20complexity%20that%20simply,all%20need%20to%20be%20addressed.)

As an organizer at [PyRVA](http://www.pyrva.org/), he comes across many people who are excited to learn Python, but discouraged by the common job posting requirement of knowing React or some other JavaScript framework. 
-->
<p>Spa user experience is no longer an advantage.</p>
<p>Chris referred to a real life case study <a class="reference external" href="https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na">Making the world‚Äôs fastest website, and other mistakes</a> by Taylor Hunt, a developer at a supermarket chain. Taylor knew their web app needed a better experience and wanted to record what customers experienced.</p>
<p>He bought several popular phones, gave them to people, and recorded them performing a task. He asked them to load either the production web app, super market chain native app, or the competitor amazon.com or walmart.com apps. Once loaded, search for eggs, add the first result to the shopping cart, and start the checkout process.</p>
<p>Chris showed a video of the results.</p>
<p>Each app takes a significant amount of time to accomplish the task, sometimes with a lag between the time the user touches the device and app response. The apps took between 59 seconds and 4 minutes to finish.</p>
<!--
amazon.com takes the lead, returns the wrong response, and finishes in 59 seconds. The native app is slowest to start, but finishes second at 1:21. The other two websites take almost 4 minutes to accomplish the task. 
-->
<p>Ranging from 59 seconds to 4 minutes to finish
<img alt="" src="_images/chris-demo-1.png" /></p>
<p>Taylor knew it could be better and had a vision: ‚ÄúBe so fast it‚Äôs fun on the worst devices and networks our customers use.‚Äù</p>
<p>He found some advice from 2017- for optimal website performance, establish a budget of 130 kb or less (first download- HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Due to the third party JavaScript data collection tools and use of ReactJS and Redux in the production app, he could not meet the budget as a SPA app. He decided to focus on HTML, with minimal CSS and laser-focused JavaScript that required complex interactivity.</p>
<p>His demo app was the functional equivalent of the production app (using same phone, internet, server, APIs, data), with a drastically elevated experience. Much quicker to load and interact with, it finished in 20 seconds.</p>
<p>20 seconds to finish!
<img alt="" src="_images/chris-demo-2.png" /></p>
<p>Due to the capabilities of new tools, Django websites can be just as friendly as SPAs and much easier to maintain. In the talk, Chris would show us how.</p>
<p>Chris told the story of Caleb, a Laravel developer at Titan, one of the best PHP shops. He realized there was a significant cost and complexity to SPAs, so he decided to default to traditional web apps and only choose a SPA when needed. But, after starting to create a web app, he would always feel a gravitational pull back to SPA. He realized the seminal decision causing this would be when you decide to return JSON from the server. You need JavaScript on the page to receive the request. If you return HTML, you need much less JavaScript on the page to handle it. He created a framework called <a class="reference external" href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Livewire</a> for Laravel Developers.</p>
<!--
[django-unicorn](https://www.django-unicorn.com/) has the same philosophy. 
-->
<p>Python and Django devs have adopted a different framework called <a class="reference external" href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> that is growing in popularity. HTMX enables JavaScript-like functionality, without the use of JavaScript, such as re-rendering part of a page using AJAX at the cost of just 14 kb.</p>
<p>Alpine was created to support Livewire. According to Chris, it‚Äôs an incredible framework that can create rich interactions with very little JavaScript. Its focus is the in-page experience. You can use it to create mobile components, make dynamic forms. It is reactive, so any data on the page associated with HTML will updated when changed.</p>
<p>HTMX and Alpine together can enable you to give your users a SPA-like experience for less than 30 kb.</p>
<p><img alt="Five components of elevated experiences: remove whole page refreshes for every interaction- accomplished with HTMX, use small pyaloads form the server to update the interface- accomplished with HTMX, update HTML as a result of changes in data- accomplished with Alpine, empower rich on-page interactions- accomplished with Alpine, be fast" src="_images/chris-components-of-elevated-experience.png" /></p>
<!--
While both of these frameworks have JavaScript interfaces, they are optimized to use HTML attributes. Instead of working with JavaScript and making it compile, with HTMX and Alpine, you can define the behavior in your HTML file. You can potentially remove the JavaScript build system. 
-->
<p>These two frameworks, along with Tailwind CSS have brought the joy of web dev back to his life. He hadn‚Äôt realized how much it had faded over time.</p>
<p><img alt="Developer Experience boost: Both frameworks can use HTML attributes to control behavior, locality, remove your JS build system, write mostly Python and HTML, easier maintenance, faster iteration cycles" src="_images/chris-developer-experience-boost.png" /></p>
<!--
(this creates locality- see Carlton Gibson's talk)

Chris referred to a talk by David Guillot at DjangoCon Europe. David described his company's transition from React to HTMX. There were no negative tradeoffs. There were positive tradeoffs. By removing React, you can make use of the native browser, which creates many new possibilities such as the capability of rendering large docs. Website performance was also a big win. Django/React interactivity took up to six seconds to render. The Django/HTMX version took up to 2. 
-->
<p>Chris then wanted to focus on the ‚ÄúBe fast‚Äù component of elevated experience, which he said could trump the rest.</p>
<p>SPAs using React and other JavaScript frameworks have a hidden cost- time to boot up.</p>
<!--
While working the HTTP Archive, an archive of as much of the web as possible, Tim Kadlec found that half of all websites built with React took over ten seconds to render on a mobile device. 10% of sites build with React took over 25 seconds to load on mobile, which can lead to significant user experience issues. 
-->
<p>Chris went back to the production app and demonstrated that the JavaScript prep took so much phone resource that it caused the text input to lag. The eggs search was deleted and the app then attempted to find 360,000 items and summarize them on the page instead. The user would then have to research, taking over a minute and a half.</p>
<p>In the demo app, the transaction happens very quickly, before the app has finished loading. As soo as the search bar appears, it is able to be used for a search. Critical elements are delivered as quickly as possible, and the user is not prevented from accomplishing their goal.</p>
<p>Chris wants Python developers to be able to do this.</p>
<p>Currently, Python will obtain all of the data, put it in the template, then send it in the response. This is ok, but can hurt user experience.</p>
<p>Chris proposes that when the request comes in, we start sending the template as soon as we can and continue sending pieces of it as they become available, until it‚Äôs done. This can be done using streaming HTML technology that has been around since 1997. Every browser is already optimized to use it.</p>
<!--
What we want...
![](djangocon-us-2023-recap-images/chris-what-we-want.png)
-->
<p>Chris created a recommendation engine and engineered it to take up to five seconds to load recommendations on the homepage.</p>
<!--
Currently, we won't see anything on the page until all of the template is complete. 
-->
<p>If the CSS container element does not have four items, the page will render the CSS skeleton elements shaped like the eventual content. This will prevent the page from jumping around as it renders. Each recommendation will be sent when it is ready. Meanwhile, the user can use the site.</p>
<!--
He called this a ridiculous example and acknowledged that all sorts of things outside of our control can slow things down, but said it's a great pattern. He showed an example of this in real life in the wild. In a GitHub repo, when you click on any file to drill down into it, GitHub allows critical elements to appear quickly and does not prevent you from accomplishing your goal, but nice to have details load async. 
-->
<p>He demonstrated how to create the demo functionality in Django using Django 4.2‚Äôs new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StreamingHttpResponse</span></code> async functionality. Unfortunately, as of the conference, this pattern only works with Jinja templates.</p>
<p>He also showed some patterns that work with Django templates too.</p>
<p><img alt="Option 1: Split templates into parts, yield each one via Django 4.2's new async iteration in " src="_images/chris-option-1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Option 2: Render a view, subscribe to HTMX Server-Side Events, send the slow parts to the page when they're ready" src="_images/chris-option-2.png" /></p>
<!--
HTMX Server-Side Events
![](djangocon-us-2023-recap-images/chris-htmx-sse.png)
-->
<p>These are not the only options. Chris has created a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PyHAT-stack/web-async-patterns">web-async-patterns repo</a> in PyHAT-stack GitHub organization. He wants your contributions. He believes that the community can create better patterns that empower us and enable Django to do new things.</p>
<p>Chris closed by summarizing what created an exception experience.
<img alt="Exceptional Experiences with Django: Using  to stream critical elements to the user as quickly as possible, use HTML fragments to update parts of the page with HTMX, leverage scoped down frameworks like Alpine.js to power rich interactions" src="_images/chris-exceptional-experiences.png" /></p>

<p>Chaim Kirby, Django Software Foundation (DSF) President, asked <a class="reference external" href="https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/what-can-the-dsf-i-do-for-me-the-dsf/">What Can the DSF Do for Me? What Can I Do for the DSF?</a></p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/what-can-the-dsf.jpg" /></p>
<p>What can the DSF do for me? He gave a report card:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support development of Django by sponsoring sprints, meetups, gatherings¬†and community¬†events: B</p></li>
<li><p>Promote the use of Django among the World Wide Web development community: D</p></li>
<li><p>Project the intellectual property and the framework‚Äôs long-term viability: A</p></li>
<li><p>Advance the state of the art in web development: no grade</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chaim gave a special thanks to DSF Board Assistant Catherine Holmes: ‚ÄúHonestly, we could disappear and if Catherine sticks around, things keep going.‚Äù</p>
<p>What can I do for the DSF?</p>
<p>Chaim announced two new initiatives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Change to DSF membership qualification</p></li>
<li><p>DSF Working Groups</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, DSF membership has been available to people who shared IP with the DSF- that is, literally wrote code or documentation.</p>
<p>DSF membership will now go beyond code or documentation to recognize the myriad of ways that people support the Django community. It will be predicated on making meaningful contributions toward the purpose of the DSF.</p>
<p>The DSF is also changing how its day-to-day work gets done by re-distributing power from the DSF Board to working groups. The working groups will be tracked in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups">DSF Working Groups GitHub repo</a>. If you have an idea for how to better achieve a DSF goal, there is a process and template. You can nominate yourself to define a working group and the board will review, with the potential for a budget.</p>
<p>Chaim gave a special thanks to Jacob Kaplan-Moss for taking the lead on the DSF Working Groups initiative.</p>

<h3>Navigating Django‚Äôs Future: Djangonaut Space<a class="headerlink" href="#navigating-django-s-future-djangonaut-space" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>It was at <a class="reference external" href="https://2018.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US 2018</a> that I personally first recall a growing sense of discontent being publicly expressed, for example in this talk that year by former Django Fellow Carlton Gibson, <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/1BFjg9XtptM?si=oUQr3y2monEzCoud">Your Framework Needs You</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote about it in this <a class="reference external" href="https://katherinemichel.github.io/blog/conferences/djangocon-us-2019-recap.html#your-web-framework-needs-you">DjangoCon US 2019 recap blog post</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCarlton acknowleged that the (Django) community is more diverse than ever, but the core contributors have continued to be white guys, many of whom have been associated with Django for a very long time and are no longer even contributing. The talk was a call to action to community members to contribute to the Django core code. In short, there is not a quick fix, but change is a priority.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the words of Carlton Gibson, ‚ÄúHow do we get non-white blokes?‚Äù</p>
<p>After DjangoCon US 2018, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0010-new-governance.rst">DEP 10</a> dissolving Django Core and creating a new model of governance was accepted. This DEP was in part intended to fix some of the problems discussed by Carlton in his talk. James Bennett, the author of the DEP, explained the changes in his blog post <a class="reference external" href="https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/nov/20/core/">Core no more</a>. Django project was not attracting enough new contributors to replace the ones becoming inactive and there was a lack of diversity among those new contributors.</p>
<p>During the <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/IumYtz0G5v0?si=J6G24BdVXIf-94ZS">DjangoCon US 2022 State of Django Panel</a>, this gap was still strongly felt. This was a topic that had come up many times before, but nothing had been done. Django Fellow Mariusz Felisiak said, ‚ÄúMy hot take is that we need a mentorship program‚Ä¶ for new Django Core Developers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dawn Wages, PSF Chair, and Rachell Calhoun, Django Girls Trustee, knew this was a powerful idea and went to work.</p>
<p>Also inspired by the DjangoCon US 2022 State of Django Panel, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0012-steering-council.rst">DEP 12</a> was an effort to encourage diversification of the Django Steering Committee, the governing body that determines the technical direction of Django, but this effort has fallen short in the most recent election.</p>
<p>In their talk <a class="reference external" href="https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/navigating-djangos-future-djangonaut-space/">Navigating Django‚Äôs Future: Djangonaut Space</a>, Dawn Wages, PSF Chair, and Rachell Calhoun, Django Girls Trustee, told how Djangonaut Space, an inclusive mentorship program for new Django Core contributors, was kickstarted.</p>
<p>Dawn and Rachell killing it on stage and keeping it real :)
<img alt="" src="_images/dawn-and-rachell.jpg" /></p>
<p>Dawn and Rachell talked about their non-traditional paths to becoming Django developers and the huge impact Django Girls has had on their lives. Many Django careers have been started through <a class="reference external" href="https://djangogirls.org/en/">Django Girls</a>.</p>
<p>Being connected with a Python user group got Dawn moving from analyst to developer. <a class="reference external" href="https://2016.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US 2016</a> in Philadelphia started her relationship with Django and that‚Äôs why she is here. She fell in love with Django. Her story is also ‚Äúnot all highlights‚Äù and she would like to talk with you more about that.</p>
<p>Through Rachell‚Äôs involvement with Django Girls Seoul, she was pushed to become a leader of the organization. This connected her with the wider community and eventually DjangoCons. She was encouraged to submit a talk proposal and gave her first talk at DjangoCon US. Rachell never would have imagined that she could give a successful conference talk.</p>
<p>This was a common a theme that came up throughout the conference that works: invite underrepresented people in, empower them, and encourage them to do things they might not think they are capable of doing. This helps them break their own boundaries.</p>
<p>Rachell said, ‚ÄúHistorically-excluded groups of people are just that. Excluded. And they often don‚Äôt feel comfortable stepping up or making that first connection. If there‚Äôs a mentorship program (you need) somebody to be like, ‚Äòhey why don‚Äôt you try this?‚Äô or ‚Äòhey, you would be great at this!‚Äô and just bring them along and include them.‚Äù</p>
<p>She went on to say, ‚ÄúThese policies and initiatives¬†that focus on inclusivity, connection, sponsorship, and accountability are not just points to get. These initiatives‚Ä¶ are really important in sustaining community, but also including people that might not have been included before and opening doors. They work, and I‚Äôm here and Dawn‚Äôs here. A lot of people are here and becoming leaders in the community because of these kind of initiatives.‚Äù</p>
<p>The magic of Django Girls‚Ä¶ Dawn and Rachell are alumnae
<img alt="" src="_images/celebration.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Djangonaut Space Organizers were able to take lessons from other mentorship programs that already exist, such as Google Summer of Code, Kubernetes, Underdog Devs, Django Girls, and Outreachy, and apply them to this new problem.</p>
<p>The first flight was a ‚Äúroaring success.‚Äù It lasted 3 months.</p>
<p>They found an active approach to inclusion to be more effective than a passive one. People will be more likely to participate if you reach out to them directly.</p>
<p>They focused on high-touch, quality communication, and retention. They supported people with kindness and worked around their lives.</p>
<p>Dawn and Rachell clarified that Djangonaut Space is not just for underrepresented people, but the goal is to make everyone comfortable. That inclusivity will benefit the entire group.</p>
<p>They gave examples of accountability, connection, sponsorship, and inclusivity at work in the program:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Acountability- regular catch ups and sharing</p></li>
<li><p>Connection- although Django community doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútrade on celebrity‚Äù it was welcoming and empowering for participants to engage with people who have done ‚Äúbig things‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>Sponsorship- celebrate wins, give a talk, encourage someone to give a talk, make connections, share links and resources, ‚Äúlike‚Äù Djangonaut social media posts</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusivity- creating representation in a safe space</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Stats
<img alt="" src="_images/djangonaut-space-stats.png" /></p>
<p>After the program:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>80% feel more comfortable contributing to Django</p></li>
<li><p>80% feel more comfortable participating the Django community</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What does it take to be a Djangonaut? You don‚Äôt have to be part of Djangonaut Space. You are doing it now: write, code, raise your hand, give feedback, comment on threads, organize events, speak at events, attend events</p>
<p>Dawn and Rachel gave a call to action to contribute to Djangonaut Space:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be a participant</p></li>
<li><p>Give a talk to future Djangonauts</p></li>
<li><p>Connect your organization as a partner</p></li>
<li><p>Initiate a collaborative session</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Djangonaut Space is now <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/oct/19/djangonaut-space-now-accepting-applications/">accepting applications</a> for an eight week session in early 2024! The deadline is November 15.</p>

<h3>Don‚Äôt Buy the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù Hype<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-buy-the-ai-hype" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>While <a class="reference external" href="https://2022.djangocon.us/news/introducing-conference-chair-logan/">DjangoCon US 2022 Chair Logan Kilpatrick</a>, first DevRel hire at OpenAI, is busy getting OpenAI‚Äôs first developer conference <a class="reference external" href="https://openai.com/blog/announcing-openai-devday">OpenAI DevDay</a> off the ground, Tim Allen, gave an impassioned talk <a class="reference external" href="https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/dont-buy-the-ai-hype/">Don‚Äôt Buy the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù Hype</a> the he had put together at the last minute to fill an open slot.</p>
<p>Tim has been writing code since 1980. Over the years, he has seen a lot of tech trends and hype, and has been involved in some of it. He has never seen anything like what he calls the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù hype cycle. According to Tim, it‚Äôs next level. At the risk of sounding ‚Äúlike an old man yelling at kids to get off my lawn,‚Äù he wants to provide a warning.</p>
<p>Tim on stage
<img alt="" src="_images/tims-talk.jpg" /></p>
<p>Tim cited a KPMG report that says that 93% of senior business leaders believe that generative AI will provide value for their businesses. He does not dispute that.</p>
<p>He compared the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Trends 2023 with generative AI at the peak that he calls ‚ÄúMount Hype‚Äù with the Dunning-Kruger effect curve. He believes the similarity is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Tim gave an entertaining rundown of technology trends over the past 25 years. They were all useful tools in the technology toolbox, but did not live up to the hype. According to Tim, the media builds the technology up to ‚ÄúMount Hype‚Äù for clickbait, then tears it apart in its descent. By blinding the world with hype and fear, it‚Äôs impossible to find the true utility of these new technologies and use them to improve the human condition.</p>
<p>Tim told the story of the startup he built as a web portal for Second Life virtual world. Hyped to the max, Second life was the media‚Äôs darling, then became its whipping boy.</p>
<p>He says among generative AI companies, it‚Äôs now an arms race, and the race to the bottom ‚Äúis dangerous.‚Äù He puts ‚ÄúAI‚Äù in quotation marks, because he says it‚Äôs not AI, it‚Äôs machine learning models, a subset of AI. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not artificial and it‚Äôs not intelligent.‚Äù It‚Äôs dangerous to give these attributes to machine learning models. By saying that models ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù (a.k.a. make things up) we are removing the responsibility of the programmer and model trainer to be ethical.</p>
<p>With these falsehoods becoming part of the permanent record, we risk the line of collective truth becoming so blurred, it‚Äôs invisible.</p>
<p>He believes that a large portion of our population have been left behind by the education system and are easily misled. He fears that we are unprepared for the effect of generative AI on future elections.</p>
<p>He doesn‚Äôt have an easy answer, but says that as technologists we must be responsible stewards and do better.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to stop falling for it.‚Äù</p>

<p>In a multi-tenancy architecture, all tenants share the same database and application instance, but each tenant is isolated from the rest, and you have to implement the isolation. A user can belong to multiple tenants, but can only access resources from the tenants to which they belong.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMultitenancy is a software architecture where a single software instance can serve multiple, distinct user groups.‚Äù- <a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-multitenancy#:~:text=Multitenancy%20is%20a%20software%20architecture,an%20example%20of%20multitenant%20architecture.">Red Hat‚Äôs definition</a></p>
<p>According to Eliana, multi-tenancy is more common when a company uses your product and will have its own users, not when you market directly to the end user.</p>
<p>She referred to Slack as a possible example of multi-tenancy architecture: each workspace is a tenant, isolated from each other, and users can access multiple workspaces, but can only access workspaces to which they belong, and information does not cross from one workspace to another.</p>
<p>Eliana showed an example app that was an abstraction of the requirements from a number of different multi-tenant websites that she and her colleagues had implemented.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The tenants are represented as companies</p></li>
<li><p>The resources are represented as company reports</p></li>
<li><p>The user can access many companies (an example user is a fractional account who does accounting for multiple companies)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key points</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Effectively nest API routes so resources fall under the specific tenant</p></li>
<li><p>Consistently restrict access to resources</p></li>
<li><p>Centralize checks in a single place to avoid code duplication</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They used <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alanjds/drf-nested-routers">drf-nested-routers</a> package to nest resources under a specific tenant.</p>
<p>URL example: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tenant/&lt;tenant-id&gt;&lt;some-resource/&lt;resource-id&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>In order for this to work, a few lines of code need to be added to urls.py.</p>
<!--
Screenshot- explain
-->
<p>If there is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">company_id</span></code> 23 associated with a report with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">id</span></code> 1 and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">company_id</span></code> 5 associated with a report with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">id</span></code> 2:</p>
<p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GET</span></code> request to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">companies/23/reports/1</span></code> will return a 200 HTTP status
A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GET</span></code> request to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">companies/5/reports/1</span></code> will return a 404 HTTP status</p>
<p>She then explained how they write a custom viewset and overrided the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">initial()</span></code> method to implement tenancy check functionality to restrict user access to resources.</p>
<p>First they check that the user is logged in and get the company primary key from the URL. If either is missing an exception is raised. They then get the user from the request. Instead of looking up the company using the primary key, they look for it within the user‚Äôs set of companies. The company needs to exist and be among the user‚Äôs set of companies in order for it to be returned.</p>
<p>Eliana and her colleagues would occasionally forget to filter by company which would result in accidentally leaking information from other tenants. As a bonus, she demonstrated how they created a custom model manager to avoid this.</p>
<p>They would override the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">filter()</span></code> method and check if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">company_id</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">company</span></code> is in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kwargs</span></code>. If not, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MissingCompanyException</span></code> is raised. If either exists, company is filtered like intended with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kwarg</span></code>.</p>

<h3>Testing Modern Web Apps Like a Champion<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-modern-web-apps-like-a-champion" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>My friend Andrew ‚ÄúPandy‚Äù Knight delivered the Wednesday morning keynote <a class="reference external" href="https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-testing-modern-web-apps-like-a-champion/">Testing Modern Web Apps Like a Champion</a>.</p>
<p>Andy is a local and learned development through Django. At DjangoCon US 2019, he gave a <a class="reference external" href="https://2019.djangocon.us/tutorials/hands-on-web-ui-testing/">Selenium tutorial</a>. It was special for him to be back four years later giving a keynote about testing.</p>
<p>Andy introduced us to Suki, his French bulldog. He created <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/AutomationPanda/bulldoggy-reminders-app">Bulldoggy Reminders app</a> to help him take care of his dog.</p>
<p>Users can log in. On the left side are the reminders lists they have created. On the right side are the items in a list. Users can dynamically add items to lists, rename lists, and delete lists. When an item is completed they can strike through it by clicking on it.</p>
<p>The app was made with FastAPI, HTMX, and stores data in TinyDB.</p>
<p>Bulldoggy app architecture
<img alt="" src="_images/andy-bulldoggy-app-architecture.png" /></p>
<p>Andy singing the praises of HTMX
<img alt="&quot;Another high level endorsement of HTMX: ‚ÄúHTMX is a great way to democratize front-end development.‚Äù Andrew Knight&quot;" src="_images/another-high-level.png" /></p>
<p>Testing is an art and a science, Andy said. Development and testing are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>This talk was a bookend for a keynote Andy did at PyTexas that focused on the full-stack Python development of Bulldoggy Reminders app.</p>
<p>In this talk, Andy would be talking about how to test the app.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTesting is hard.‚Äù</p>
<p>Testing Challenges
<img alt="" src="_images/andy-testing-challenges.png" /></p>
<p>Historically, testing strategy has been built around the Test Pyramid that has probably been around longer than Andy has been in a professional environment. :)</p>
<p>According to the strategy, we want a lot of unit tests. They are white box, next to the code, low level, very fast, touching the Python methods. Moving up the pyramid, if we have UI, we want to test the widget library as components. Moving up the pyramid, we reach API testing. We make a request, get a response, verify a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">200</span></code> code. They take a bit longer to run and there could be network issues, but they are ok. We reach UI tests. We want to do as few of them as possible. They are the most complex, longest, slowest, most brittle, most prone to flakiness, the riskiest.</p>
<p>Test Pyramid Scheme
<img alt="" src="_images/andy-test-pyramid-scheme.png" /></p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have developed an entire testing strategy with this pyramid around presumptions that certain types of tests are good and bad. And I‚Äôm here to tell you today that‚Äôs bull crap. Every type of test adds value in unique, special ways. To try to label some as good and bad is not healthy for us as we approach the quality of our applications. I could argue that UI tests are the valuable ones because they are the ones that are testing your application as a user would.‚Äù</p>
<p>Modern testing goals- let‚Äôs break away from the pyramid and its preconceived notions
<img alt="" src="_images/andy-modern-testing-goals.png" /></p>
<p>While testing can be challenging, our approach to testing doesn‚Äôt need to be.</p>
<p>Writing good tests: follow the Arrange-Act-Assert method:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Arrange</em> things in the system</p></li>
<li><p><em>Act</em> on the target behavior</p></li>
<li><p><em>Assert</em> expected outcomes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Arrange-Act-Assert works for all types of functional tests, whether they are unit, component, API, or UI. This pattern came up over and over again in the talk.</p>
<p>Can‚Äôt we just use pytest or unittest? Andy loves pytest. He is a pytest stan and thinks it is the best testing framework in any language, but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>pytest and unnitest cannot test web apps or frameworks. They provide the structure for writing test cases. You need to add the ‚Äúmagic sauce‚Äù inside the test cases. pytest alone is not the answer.</p>
<p>What about Django‚Äôs testing support? Django has an awesome test client. Django testing support is probably some of the best Andy has seen in a Python web framework, but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You are going to be limited to ‚Äúwhite box‚Äù testing of calling methods and functions directly from the code. You‚Äôre not going to be able to test the app like a user by opening up a browser and clicking around or calling the API with a REST client.</p>
<p>Andy pointed out the ‚Äúwhite box‚Äù unit testing at the bottom of the pyramid and ‚Äúblack box‚Äù testing of the components above.</p>
<p>Tools for black box testing‚Ä¶ Cypress and Playwright can do all of these things
<img alt="" src="_images/andy-tools-for-black-box-testing.png" /></p>
<p>Focusing on open source tools, Andy went over how to do component, API, and UI testing, with examples and pitfalls from his own personal experience.</p>

<img alt="" src="_images/andy-test-modern-web-apps.png" /></p>
<p>Afterw the talk, I had the chance to catch up with Andy. His talk has rekindled my desire to get better at testing and reminded me of what a great resource <a class="reference external" href="https://testautomationu.applitools.com/">Test Automation University</a> is. He gave me a card resource too!</p>

<p><img alt="&quot;The &#64;djangocon US CfP closes May 15th. We'd LOVE to receive your talk proposal! If you need some inspiration, I've written up a list of possible topics. What topics would you like to learn more about? ‚ù§Ô∏èüêç&quot;" src="_images/the-djangocon-us-cfp.png" /></p>
<p>Tim Schilling, who has done an incredible job of taking over my former role of DEFNA Corporate Secretary and driving a lot of improvement across DEFNA and DjangoCon US, tooted to me and Natalia in response.</p>

<p><img alt="&quot;&#64;CodenameTim &#64;kati &#64;djangocon I've been thinking about this a lot, and I would be most thrilled to prepare a talk.

Would that be a talk you'd like to see/attend?&quot;" src="_images/i%27ve-been-thinking-about-this-a-lot.png" /></p>
<p>In her talk, Natalia gave some examples of prejudice that she has faced as a woman. Thank you Natalia for putting into words the type of that experiences I‚Äôve also had, but have questioned.</p>
<p>She explained what unconscious bias is and that we are unaware of it. Her hope is that we will reflect on our unconscious biases to improve the Django community as a whole.</p>
<p>She then talked about the conflicting standards women are expected to meet. I personally found this to be a very powerful part of her talk.</p>

<h3>DjangoCon Africa<a class="headerlink" href="#djangocon-africa" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Daniele Procida has been involved in organizing and attending African PyCons for nearly a decade now. He spoke of the special challenges, including questions of safety.</p>
<p>Daniele said we should not just be asking these questions about African events. We should be asking them about events in all countries, including our own. Other countries need to come with safety warnings as well.</p>
<p>African PyCons are creating safe spaces through codes of conduct. It‚Äôs an investment in courage. ‚ÄúThis is what we do and this is how we are.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also pointed out that African PyCons and DjangoCon operate on a shoestring budget. For example, PyCon Namibia‚Äôs total conference budget was less than $7,000 USD. The conference finished with a balance of just over $100 USD.</p>
<p>Daniele asked DjangoCon Africa Keynoter and Organizers to come up to the stage.</p>

<img alt="" src="_images/djangocon-africa.jpg" /></p>
<p>Daniele praised DjangoCon US for doing exactly the same work from another part of the world. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen so many African and Black faces, non-white faces, as a proportion at an event outside Africa.‚Äù</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://2023.djangocon.africa/">DjangoCon Africa 2023</a> will take place in Tanzania, Africa in November and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/oct/14/djangocon-europe-2024/">DjangoCon Europe 2024</a> will take place in Vigo, Spain in June 2024.</p>
<p>I hope to go to both someday.</p>
<p>One day at lunch, I had the pleasure of eating with a table of Africans: Richard Ackon, Abigail ‚ÄúAfi‚Äù Gbadago, Noah Alorwu, Ntale Geofrey, and Benedict Kofi Amofah. I learned that Ghanians are laid back and Ugandians are tribal. We had the chance to speak at length about our cultures. It was a really fun conversation!</p>
<p>New friends‚Ä¶ beautiful on the inside and out! (photo courtesy of Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe)

<p>Later in the week, a Black attendee told me that when he attends a conference in the U.S. or Europe, he is sometimes the only Black person in attendance. DjangoCon US was a very different and wonderful experience.</p>
<p>By one organizer‚Äôs count, we had around 10 Black speakers.</p>
<p>Check out the Black Python Devs write-up about their <a class="reference external" href="https://blackpythondevs.com/blog/djangocon-us-2023.html">DjangoCon US experience</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="&quot;This makes me smile. ‚ù§Ô∏è We are nowhere near where we want to be on diversity, but making big strides. I think this was the most fun DjangoCon US I've been to so far, and the growing diversity played a big part in that.&quot;" src="_images/this-makes-me-smile.png" /></p>

<p>After conference activities, as usual, hanging around in the lobby led to a great adventure. Hanging around in a lobby once led to me sitting next to Python creator and BDFL Guido van Rossum at an impromptu group dinner and chatting with him about the early days of Python.</p>
<p>On this night, I ended up having dinner with Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Andrew Godwin (Django Core Dev, Django Async Architect, South creator, and the only person who has attended every DjangoCon US), Frank Wiles (Revsys Founder and Partner, and former DSF President), and Tim and and Charles of the Wharton School, my past client.</p>
<p>We ate at a restaurant called <a class="reference external" href="https://getsouthernfood.com/">It‚Äôs a Southern Thing</a>. The food was high quality and the service was great. I had the Crispy Catfish.</p>

<p>After having read rave reviews about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.loafdurham.com/">Loaf</a> bakery, I had to pay a visit. It did not disappoint. I ordered a ham and gruyere croissant, a walnut sea salt brownie, a pain au chocolat, and 5 pumpkin chocolate chip cookies.</p>

<p>For dinner one night, I ordered takeaway from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pizzeriatoro.com/">Pizzeria Toro</a>, right around the corner from the Marriott. I had a mouthwatering red-sauce pizza with shredded mozzarella, black olives, mixed mushrooms, and fennel sausage.</p>
<p>Cool atmosphere!

<p>After having read rave reviews about <a class="reference external" href="https://pressccc.com/locations/durham/">Press Coffee, Crepes, and Cocktails</a> at the <a class="reference external" href="https://americantobacco.co/">American Tobacco Campus</a>, I simply had to visit. I was keen to have a seasonal Black Forest Latte. I finally had the opportunity on the first day of sprints. The atmosphere was bright and cute. The food was excellent. I think this was the first time that I‚Äôve ever had a savory crepe.</p>

<p>The talk replays will be available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DjangoConUS">DjangoCon US YouTube channel</a> in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Can‚Äôt wait for next year! :)</p>
<p><img alt="&quot;As usual, I've tried to squeeze every last bit of experience out of DjangoCon US and have done about as much as I humanly can. ü§£ Today is a day for relaxed sprinting, catching up with a few more people, and flying back to Plano. I'll write up a proper blog post soon with thoughts about talks, the people I met, sightseeing, and food. For the moment, suffice it to say, this conference just gets better every year and that is because of the people. Everyone is welcome and everyone makes it a better place. This community is changing the world for the better through shared humanity and technology. And, it's not a coincidence that it started in wonderful Lawrence, Kansas.&quot;" src="_images/as-usual.png" /></p>
