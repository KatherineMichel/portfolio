<p>A number of people have commented that they‚Äôve really loved the conference t-shirt and bag this year.</p>
<p>Our wonderful designer Joni Trythall of YupGup did a <a class="reference external" href="https://jonitrythall.com/dcus-design-reflection">DjangoCon US Design Reflection</a> featuring all of our designs since 2018.</p>
<p>As a DEFNA Board Member, I‚Äôve had the pleasure of collaborating with Joni in bringing all of these designs to life. They are so beautiful!</p>
<p>Thank you to Joni for a special shoutout at the end of her post.</p>
<p>In addition, we did a refactor of our DjangoCon US website backend this year. It‚Äôs easier to get up and running and has a well documented style guide.</p>
<p>Feel free to fork it and use it in line with the license.</p>

<h3>Sightseeing and Some Great Meals<a class="headerlink" href="#sightseeing-and-some-great-meals" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>I feel privileged to be able to travel. I make the most of every opportunity to get to know a place better: seeing the unique sights, experiencing what makes the culture special, and enjoying the celebrated local cuisine.</p>
<p>In Durham, I had the chance to revisit the incredible Sarah P. Duke Gardens and see a few other attractions for the first time. Also, although most of my meals were provided through the conference, I enjoyed some outstanding meals in downtown Durham restaurants.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorite moments from the trip. See more photos and anecdotes at the end of this post.</p>

<p>Sheena O‚ÄôConnell has been an educator since childhood and began working for an education non-profit called Umuzi in 2018. She is interested in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>, how people learn.</p>
<p>She began her talk by describing the education status quo: common learning anti-patterns, what a normal classroom looks like, and normal success distribution.</p>
<p>She introduced <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem">Bloom‚Äôs 2 Sigma Problem</a>. ‚ÄúThe average student tutored one-to-one using mastery learning techniques performed two standard deviations better than students educated in a classroom environment.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mastery learning techniques
<img alt="" src="_images/sheena-mastery-learning-techniques.png" /></p>
<p>A few advantages of mastery-based learning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Social contract- students are more motivated due to buy-in</p></li>
<li><p>It helps students develop a growth mindset</p></li>
<li><p>It helps the teacher master teaching (‚Äúdid I do a good job of teaching?‚Äù)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few thoughts on learning</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you teach one person, it can impact many others</p></li>
<li><p>Struggle is good, teach students how to learn</p></li>
<li><p>Some teaching techniques are more powerful than others</p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúTrust no one‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt teach a person to ride a bicycle by riding a bicycle for them.‚Äù</p></li>

<h3>Choosing Wisely: SPA vs. HTMX for Your Next Web Project<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-wisely-spa-vs-htmx-for-your-next-web-project" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Last year, in his talk HTML-ivating your Django web app‚Äôs experience with HTMX, AlpineJS, and streaming HTML, Chris May introduced the idea that you can have a SPA-like experience in Django without using SPA tools.</p>
<p>I wrote about it in my <a class="reference external" href="https://katherinemichel.github.io/blog/conferences/djangocon-us-2023-recap.html#html-ivating-your-django-web-app-s-experience-with-htmx-alpinejs-and-streaming-html">DjangoCon US 2023 Recap</a>.</p>
<p>In that talk, he referenced a Thoughtworks article <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar/techniques/spa-by-default">SPA by Default</a> and Tayor Hunt‚Äôs <a class="reference external" href="https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na">Making the World‚Äôs Fastest Website and Other Mistakes</a></p>
<p>According to Thoughtworks, ‚ÄúToo often teams are skipping [that] trade-off analysis, blindly accepting the complexity of SPAs by default even when business needs don‚Äôt justify it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Taylor Hunt refactored a React/Redux grocery store SPA app for a much improved experience by using just HTML, CSS, and laser-focused JavaScript.</p>
<p>Chris started this year‚Äôs talk off by asking some questions: Are you using a SPA? What would make you change? When do you think you should use a SPA? Why would you want to use HTMX versus SPA? What tools are you favorite tools? Are you using them well?</p>
<p>SPA downsides</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Slow startup time</p></li>
<li><p>Bad user experience on slow devices</p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúA massive investment in controlling complexity is the only way to scale JS-driven frontends.‚Äù Alex Russell in <a class="reference external" href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">The Market for Lemons</a></p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúNot only does JavaScript cost 3x more in processing power, byte-for-byte, than HTML and CSS, but it also removes the browser‚Äôs ability to parallelise page loading.‚Äù Alex Russell in <a class="reference external" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/">Caprock</a></p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúWhen using JavaScript you pay a performance tax no less than four times.‚Äù Tim Kadlec in <a class="reference external" href="https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks">The Cost of JavaScript Frameworks</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>How the front-end is coping
<img alt="" src="_images/chris-how-the-frontend-is-coping.png" /></p>
<p>When SPAs could be worth their weight (Alex Russell in <a class="reference external" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/">Caprock</a>)
<img alt="" src="_images/chris-when-spas-could-be-worth-their-weight.png" /></p>
<p>When or when-not to SPA (Alex Russell in <a class="reference external" href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/">Caprock</a>)
<img alt="" src="_images/chris-specrum.png" /></p>
<p>Chris pointed out <a class="reference external" href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">Katie Sylor-Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄúComponent Islands‚Äù pattern</a> as showing promise. ‚ÄúRemoving the need for a root JavaScript component greatly reduces complexity. The browser can handle most things without JavaScript.‚Äù</p>
<p>Streamed HTML Components
<img alt="" src="_images/chris-streamed-html-components.png" /></p>
<p>Chris introduced tools that can be used to create a SPA-like experience</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting is a Lifestyle üòé<a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting-is-a-lifestyle" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Jack Linke started off the talk with a quote and described indicator categories.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf your only tool is a hammer then everything looks like a nail.‚Äù Abraham Maslow</p>
<p>Jack started with some Django built-in troubleshooting tools</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Template error pages</p></li>
<li><p>Error reporting by email</p></li>
<li><p>System checks framework (it‚Äôs extensible- dj-stripe is an example)</p></li>
<li><p>Console and logging (for extra context, use verbosity settings 1-3)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Django System Checks Framework
<img alt="" src="_images/jack-django-systems-check-framework.png" /></p>
<p>He then moved on to some third-party packages and tools</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django-commons/django-debug-toolbar">django-debug-toolbar</a> (also extensible)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-silk">django-silk</a> performance profiler</p></li>
<li><p>Error tracking and performance monitoring- Sentry, Rollbar, Newrelic, Honeybadger, Bugsnag, Raygun</p></li>
<li><p>He gave a demo of <a class="reference external" href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">Sentry</a> dashboard with error page, error message, tags</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/revsys/django-health-check">django-health-check</a> package (can add Celery, Redis, Postgres)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mwarkentin/django-watchman">django-watchman</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>He gave an example of extending the Django admin by adding checks. He had an issue with Celery- too few tasks were processed. He put a panel into the admin to capture the last 24 hours of tasks processed through Celery.</p>
<p>He gave some general tips for troubleshooting</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use the power of isolating variables and narrowing scope</p></li>
<li><p>Be like Frances Elizabeth Holberton- ‚Äúbreak the execution- does the system work up to this point.‚Äù Similarly, Python Debugger (PDB) can be used to create breakpoints to step through the code to find the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid tunnel vision- seek broad perspectives and alternative approaches</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategies for dissecting complex issues
<img alt="" src="_images/jack-strategies-for-dissecting-complex-issues.png" /></p>
<p>‚ÄúA problem well stated is a problem half solved.‚Äù John Dewey</p>
<p>Troubleshooting often involves stating the problem and asking for help</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Rubber duck debugging</p></li>
<li><p>Know when to seek assistance</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to ask for help effectively</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to create a Minimum Reproducible Example (MRE) to increase your odds of getting help</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How to effectively ask for help
<img alt="" src="_images/jack-how-to-effectively-ask-for-help.png" /></p>
<p>Oh no

<p>Yep!
<img alt="" src="_images/jack-yep.png" /></p>
<p>Where to get help
<img alt="" src="_images/jack-where-to-get-help.png" /></p>
<p>Jack gave a shout out to Ken Whitesell for his prolific question- answering in the Django Forum!</p>
<p>Jack encouraged the audience to document your process.

<p>Because I am already familiar with diagnosing and fixing N+1 problems, I watched Christopher Adams‚Äôs to pick up new tips.</p>
<p>A few reminders</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Querysets are immutable</p></li>
<li><p>Querysets are lazy (they do not hit the database until they are evaluated). Chris showed examples.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few ways to profile SQL queries</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Set Django logging to debug and stream results</p></li>
<li><p>DB all-statement logging (caution- this will fill up the logs, so perhaps run it for a minute or so in staging, not prod)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-debug-toolbar</a> (install conditionally)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Good points about select_related() and prefetch_related()</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Database transaction latency is increased if the data is in another datacenter</p></li>
<li><p>Prefetch returns another queryset and this can be more efficient than if the database does it</p></li>
<li><p>People in the 90th percentile who have a slow machine can benefit</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Mario Munoz started off his keynote by introducing himself. ‚ÄúI am a person.‚Äù He went on to talk about the diverse experiences that have contributed to who he is today.</p>
<p>Mario‚Äôs talk was philosophical. He acknowledged, ‚ÄúWe all know philosophy and software engineering are the same thing.‚Äù Both involve abstract thinking, making models of intangible things, trying to apply them to real world scenarios.</p>
<p>He talked about The Mirror Stage, a concept in Jacques Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalytic theory. It refers to the time when a child identifies their own image.</p>
<p>Mario then used a Person/Ality personality simulator. Images, as though from the subconscious, appeared on the screen as he talked about experiences he‚Äôd had as a developer. Afterward, he analyzed each experience.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/mario-withdrawn-mood-self-absorbed.png" /></p>
<p>Throughout the talk, he reflected</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‚ÄúBeing a developer should in no way rob you of who you are and your own identity.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúThe biggest lie that we can tell ourselves is that these objects of representation that are outside of us are synonymous with who we are.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúEverything we tell ourselves about ourselves is always a little bit inadequate.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>Our strengths can be our biggest weakness and our weaknesses can be turned into our strengths.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end, he revealed, ‚ÄúI am a community. We are a community‚Ä¶ The community is my biggest asset.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow to be a better developer‚Ä¶ be a better person to others.‚Äù</p>

<h3>PostgreSQL Beyond Django: Strategies to Get Max Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#postgresql-beyond-django-strategies-to-get-max-performance" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>√Ålvaro Justen showed some lesser known ways to improve the performance of PostgreSQL.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PythonicCafe/djpg-example">Example code</a></p>
<p>He explained each method, including profiling results, then ran a demo.</p>
<p>Some of his suggested methods</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use UUID field as primary key field and avoid creating two columns. You do not need a sequential ID, because of the UUID hash. You can index UUID.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting at Django 3.2, the ID of each field went from 4 to 8 bytes. In settings, use the default AutoField instead of BigAutoField.</p></li>
<li><p>Alvaro prefers to create his own ID. See urlid.org for his methodology.</p></li>
<li><p>Use SQL min/max to check the size of table values. Use SmallIntegerField instead of IntegerField.</p></li>
<li><p>Column order can affect space used. Use fixed-size columns (bigger, then smaller), then variable-size. See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/data-alignment-postgresql">Data alignment in Postgres</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Full text search and search vector field scenarios</p></li>
<li><p>Trigger- perform operations inside of the database more quickly than in the app. Don‚Äôt put much business logic in the trigger.</p></li>

<p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss is a retired Django BDFL and current DSF Treasurer. He showed the current $255,000 DSF budget breakdown. Most of the budget goes to the salary for fellows (health of project) and admin (health of foundation).</p>
<p>If the budget were quadrupled to $1,000,000, he has a personal wishlist: hire an executive director, expand the fellowship and grants programs, including feature grants
<img alt="" src="_images/jacob-my-wishlist.png" /></p>
<p>How do we get there? We probably need to target major donors versus many small-funders, and that‚Äôs probably ok.</p>
<p>Major donors are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Corporations</p></li>
<li><p>High-net worth individuals</p></li>
<li><p>Government grants</p></li>
<li><p>Private foundation grants</p></li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR hire experts (executive director, grant writer, etc.) and pay them to get the money.</p>

<h3>Hidden gems of Django 5.x<a class="headerlink" href="#hidden-gems-of-django-5-x" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Django Fellow Sarah Boyce pointed out that work on <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.0/">Django 5.x</a> began in January 2023, and from her perspective, is almost done.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/sarah-django-5-x.png" /></p>
<p>Although Django release notes are the source of truth for info about releases, ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù information that you see in the release notes only constitutes 13% of the work done.</p>
<p>Need to know versus want to know
<img alt="" src="_images/sarah-need-to-know-want-to-know.png" /></p>
<p>A few examples of what you didn‚Äôt see in the release notes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A screen reader experience demo showing improved logical structure, navigation, announcement of relevant info in Django Admin</p></li>
<li><p>Accessibility Contributor Guide by Thibaud Colas</p></li>
<li><p>Code references in docs now have links to source code on GitHub</p></li>
<li><p>Django performance graph- as Python becomes faster, by simply upgrading it, the performance of your code improves</p></li>
<li><p>Significantly faster Django benchmarks for individual commits</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Admin accessibility improvements
<img alt="" src="_images/sarah-accessibility-improvements.png" /></p>
<p>Sarah recognized the huge amount of work done by many people and gave an <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35102">example ticket</a> collaborated on by Marisuz, Anthony, Simon.</p>
<p>364 people contributed to Django 5.0 and 5.1.</p>
<p>Please give the team feedback so they can work with you to make the experience better.</p>
<p>After the conference, Sarah also published a <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/sarahboyce/68ffaaeae24d2501cf27a914f77fb97c">DSF Initiatives I‚Äôd Like to See</a> list for DSF Board Election candidates. Take a look and be inspired!</p>

<h3>API Maybe: Bootstrapping a Web Application circa 2024<a class="headerlink" href="#api-maybe-bootstrapping-a-web-application-circa-2024" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Carlton Gibson, former Django Fellow, is the only worker on the tech side at his startup Paths: monitoring, evaluation, and learning for development and sustainability projects.</p>
<p>2018 was API first. 2024 is ‚ÄúHTML over the wire‚Äù and the economic climate has changed.</p>
<p>With tech funding having dried up, teams have limited budget and time.</p>
<p>He said that ‚ÄúDjango really shines when the money is tight. Django is the framework for perfectionists with deadlines. When these deadlines are financial, all the more so. Django is the perfect framework for our post zero interest rate world. ‚Äú</p>
<p>By leveraging Django, you can get as much done as teams using more complex stacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLocality of behavior is a way of thinking about and assessing code. Everything you need to understand that code is there in front of you in one place. Creating locality of behavior makes code easier to reason about, easier to maintain, easier to iterate on.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúUse your judgement as to when you sacrifice a bit of locality of behavior as your code scales to gain in maintainability.</p>
<p>Locality of behavior is a starting point, not a destination.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHolding the line on locality of behavior can really pay dividends.‚Äù</p>
<p>When working on new code that is likely to change, by focusing on locality of behavior, you can stablilize the code and let the deeper patterns emerge. Quickly refactoring to DRY code can create premature optimization that leaves the code ‚Äústuck in the local optima.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Unscripted Rooftop Pool<a class="headerlink" href="#unscripted-rooftop-pool" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>I had the chance to spend time at the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unscriptedhotels.com/">Unscripted Hotel</a>. The rooftop overlooks the downtown and features a pool, bar, and DJ. It was an unforgettable atmosphere.</p>

<h3>The Parlour<a class="headerlink" href="#the-parlour" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>I made a trip to <a class="reference external" href="https://theparlour.co/">The Parlour</a> for the second year in a row. Last year, I had chocolate and was underwhelmed. This year, I had their most popular flavor- Salted Butter Caramel. It was truly incredible. I hope to make it back to Durham someday and visit The Parlour again!</p>
