You can read my [2023 Recap](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/2023-recap.html) here. 

## Work

## January 

### Los Angeles 2023 Trip Recap

The dream Los Angeles trip that I took in early December 2023 turned into a [dream recap](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/los-angeles-2023.html) filled with my favorite stories, photos, and videos. 

My most-viewed Los Angeles videos:
* [Universal Studios Tour- King Kong](https://youtu.be/d3wERBCZHEM?si=P2SAE4GQRgXkhKDI)
* [Santa Monica Pier Carousel](https://youtu.be/TVL2gUfgNGk?si=aJjKWFcPVtTA3YV1)
* [Santa Monica Pier at Night- Ferris Wheel](https://youtu.be/cnWdL9C4ucU?si=G7QbrVFGAfQuWI7a)
* [Universal Studios Tour- Jaws](https://youtu.be/evZHAcfSnqw?si=-1P7Dd3wRPQW3I8F)

### Kinesis Advantage360

In 2020, I bought a Kinesis [Freestyle Pro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J1ZJ6XR/) split keyboard. Although the keyboard itself was fairly traditional, I loved the 20'' separation cord and tenting. The unique Kinesis [Advantage2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage2-keyboard/) keyboard had long piqued my curiosity as well. When Kinesis came out with the [Advantage360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/) split version with tenting, I finally pulled the trigger. 

This keyboard is the most comfortable that I have ever used. The contoured shape shortens reach and the thumb presses heavily used keys, instead of the pinky. 

Having said that, the layout is similar, but not exactly the same as a regular QWERTY, and I do not recommend using it if you have to "hunt and peck." Also, like the Freestyle Pro, it is one-size fits all, and slightly larger for a woman's smaller hands.

### DjangoCon US 2023 Recap

<!--

I published a [DjangoCon US Recap](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2023-recap.html) in October 2023. It was featured in [Django News Newsletter](https://django-news.com/issues/203#start). I learned in January that the recap had been Django News Newsletter's top article for months. 

## February

### Arbor Hills

### Board Games for My Nieces

I want to start doing random, fun things for my nieces. I decided to buy them some board games. 

Games purchased:
* Guess Who?
* Candy Land
* Scrabble
* Clue

I had countless hours of fun playing these when I was a kid.

We face-timed while they opened the box. They immediately began playing and loved them.

### DjangoCon US Talk Topics Inspiration List

Every year, Jeff Triplett publishes a list of talk topics he'd like to learn more about at DjangoCon US. He also encourages fellow DEFNA Board Members to publish their own. 

Last year, I finally got organized and created a [Talk Topics Inspiration List for DjangoCon US 2023](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2023-recap.html). This year, I created a [Talk Topics List for DjangoCon US 2024](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2024-topics-inspiration-list.html). 

Our talk submission stats since I began publishing my list: 
* 2022: 152
* 2023: 189
* 2024: 194

Given the popularity of my articles among the Python/Django community, I'm confident that my list played a major role in the increase in submissions. I am really proud of that! 

My list was featured in [Django News Newsletter](https://django-news.com/issues/222#start), along with [Jeff's list](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/28/djangocon-us-talks.html) and DjangoCon US Program Chair [Drew Winstel's list](https://winstel.dev/2024/03/01/talk-ideas-for-dcus-24/). 

### DjangoCon US Website Design

As a DEFNA Board Member, I help oversee DjangoCon US, including the website design. I am also an avid photographer. 

During DjangoCon US 2023, I walked around downtown Durham and took some photos of the quirky artwork there. During the always-fun website design iteration process, I shared these photos with the website team.

Snapshots I took in downtown Durham

I am super excited that my photos helped inspire this year's theme. The [website design](https://2024.djangocon.us/) makes me smile, and I hope it makes you smile too! 

![](2024-recap-images/joni-djangocon-us-website-post.png)
A shoutout from our amazing designer Joni Trythall of YupGup!

### Conference Snapshots

After years of collecting conference snapshots, I got organized and created a page of my [Favorite Conference Snapshots](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/favorite-conference-snapshots.html) and the stories behind them, as well as a page of [Speaker, Board, and Organizer Photos](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/speaker-board-and-organizer-photos.html). 

### Death in the Family

Uncle Edward and Aunt Judy were truly larger than life. It was hard to believe that they'd ever be gone. 

[Aunt Judy died](https://www.livingstonfh.com/obituary/judith-k-markel) of pancreatic cancer on April 15, 2022. My uncle's life was not so easy after that. He missed his Judy. 

Sadly, on March 29 of this year, he passed away. He died peacefully, and I am comforted by the fact that he had a smile on his face. 

You can learn more about him in his [obituary](https://www.livingstonfh.com/obituary/edward-a-markel) or the replay of his funeral. He was one-of-a-kind. 

Amazingly, my mom, his sister, provided wonderful funeral music. 

My Uncle Edward was an avid hunter. My cousin Andrea Markel Hastings organized [one last duck call](https://youtu.be/ARt_orgMi3U?si=oFeWc5Qw1Ph3PdDE) for him at the cemetery by a few of his fellow hunting buddies. There's something in my eye.

Beautiful sympathy flowers from DEFNA... in a strange coincidence, my cousin pointed out that the roses were one of my uncle's favorite colors

### Eclipse

On my way back to Plano after my uncle's funeral, I got stuck in eclipse travel. I arrived back in Plano in time for the eclipse, but hadn't had time to plan. Fortunately, JPMorganChase had me covered. Eclipse glasses were handed out around campus, and we convened outside for a watch party. It's hard to put into words what it was like to watch the eclipse with what must have been thousands of co-workers. 

Here is [a little taste of the fun](https://youtu.be/vvNfmo0zwDw?si=Tl2xj-TZ29j_Doed). This was a small portion of the crowd. Clouds intermittently covered the sun, but parted in time for the totality. The crowd cheered and Total Eclipse of the Heart played in the background. Super fun!

### Lemurs at Tanganyka Wildlife Park

Because our DjangoCon US host city Durham, North Carolina has the largest population of lemurs outside of Madagascar, we featured a "friendly" lemur on our website last year. 

![](2024-recap-images/djangocon-us-2023-website-header.png)
A "friendly" lemur with a smile on its face

After years of hearing about [Tanganyika Wildlife Park](https://twpark.com/) in Goddard, Kansas, mom and I decided to go. I had no idea until I got there that you can feed lemurs. They were so soft and gentle. I loved spending time with these real-life, friendly lemurs!

### PyCon US 2024 Recap

<!--
I've found writing a conference recap to be a good device for recording my experience and building on it. 
-->

I wrote a deep dive of my [PyCon US 2024](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/pycon-us-2024-recap.html) experience. 

### Hacker News

Not long after I posted it on social media, I got a kudo from Kenneth Reitz. 

Unbeknownst to me, Neil Stoker, Senior Director of Ratings AI at Fitch Ratings, had [submitted the recap to Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40552621). 

He tweeted to me that it was trending there. It had reached #2!

### Summer Fun for My Nieces

In keeping with my plan to do more random, fun things for my nieces, I asked my sister what I could buy them for summer. Based on her suggestion, I bought them four X-Shot fast-fill water blasters and 24 reusable, magnetic, fast-fill water balloons. 

### McClaren Sports Cars

### Innovation Week Global Hackathon 

It was an amazing Innovation Week at JPMorganChase. I attended presentations Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, then finished the week off by participating in the Global Hackathon for the second year in a row. 

My first project fell through. Feeling disheartened, Wednesday night, I looked through the projects again and saw a new one that was highly relevant to my work in the Databases Department. I reached out to the team and joined. It felt meant to be. My team was inspiring! I learned a lot and made some new friends.
