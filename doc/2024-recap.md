### DjangoCon US Talk Topics Inspiration List

Every year, Jeff Triplett publishes a list of talk topics he'd like to learn more about at DjangoCon US. He also encourages fellow DEFNA Board Members to publish their own lists. 

Last year, I finally got organized and created a [Talk Topics Inspiration List for DjangoCon US 2023](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2023-recap.html). This year, I created a [Talk Topics List for DjangoCon US 2024](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2024-topics-inspiration-list.html). 

Our talk submission stats since I began publishing my list: 
* 2022: 152
* 2023: 189
* 2024: 194

Given the popularity of my articles, I'm confident that my list played a major role in the increase in submissions.

During DjangoCon US 2023, I walked around downtown Durham and took some photos of the quirky artwork there. 

![](2024-recap-images/durham-downtown-snapshots.png)

I am super excited that my photos helped inspire this year's DjangoCon US theme. It makes me smile, and I hope it makes you smile too!

### Conference Snapshots

After years of intending to do it, I created a page of my [favorite conference snapshots](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/favorite-conference-snapshots.html) and the stories behind them, as well as a page of [speaker, board, and organizer photos](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/speaker-board-and-organizer-photos.html).

### Lemurs at Tanganyka Wildlife Park

As a DEFNA Board Member, I help oversee DjangoCon US, including the website design. Because our host city Durham, North Carolina has the largest population of lemurs outside of Madagascar, we featured a "friendly" lemur on our website last year. 

![](2024-recap-images/djangocon-us-2023-website-header.png)

After years of hearing about [Tanganyika Wildlife Park](https://twpark.com/) in Goddard, Kansas, mom and I decided to go. I had no idea until I got there that you can feed lemurs. They were so soft and gentle. I loved spending time with these real-life, friendly lemurs!
