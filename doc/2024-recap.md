### DjangoCon US Talk Topics Inspiration List

Every year, Jeff Triplett publishes a list of talk topics he'd like to learn more about at DjangoCon US. He also encourages fellow DEFNA Board Members to publish their own. 

Last year, I finally got organized and created a [Talk Topics Inspiration List for DjangoCon US 2023](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2023-recap.html). This year, I created a [Talk Topics List for DjangoCon US 2024](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2024-topics-inspiration-list.html). 

Our talk submission stats since I began publishing my list: 
* 2022: 152
* 2023: 189
* 2024: 194

Given the popularity of my articles among the Python/Django community, I'm confident that my list played a major role in the increase in submissions. I am really proud of that! 

My list was featured in [Django News Newsletter](https://django-news.com/issues/222#start), along with [Jeff's list](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/28/djangocon-us-talks.html) and DjangoCon US Program Chair [Drew Winstel's List](https://winstel.dev/2024/03/01/talk-ideas-for-dcus-24/). 

### DjangoCon US Website Design

As a DEFNA Board Member, I help oversee DjangoCon US, including the website design. I am also an avid photographer. 

During DjangoCon US 2023, I walked around downtown Durham and took some photos of the quirky artwork there.

Snapshots I took in downtown Durham

During the always-fun website design iteration process, I shared these photos with the website team. I am super excited that my photos helped inspire this year's theme. The website design makes me smile, and I hope it makes you smile too!

A shoutout from our amazing designer Joni Trythall of YupGup!

### Conference Snapshots

After years of intending to do it, I created a page of my [favorite conference snapshots](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/favorite-conference-snapshots.html) and the stories behind them, as well as a page of [speaker, board, and organizer photos](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/speaker-board-and-organizer-photos.html). 

### Death in the Family

Uncle Edward and Aunt Judy were truly larger than life. It was hard to believe that they'd ever be gone. 

[Aunt Judy died](https://www.livingstonfh.com/obituary/judith-k-markel) of pancreatic cancer on April 15, 2022. My uncle's life was not so easy after that. He missed his Judy. 

Sadly, on March 29 of this year, he passed away. He died peacefully, and I am comforted by the fact that he had a smile on his face. 

You can learn more about him in his [obituary](https://www.livingstonfh.com/obituary/edward-a-markel) or the replay of his funeral. He was one-of-a-kind. 

Amazingly, my mom, his sister, provided the funeral music. 

My Uncle Edward was an avid hunter. My cousin Andrea Markel Hastings organized one last duck call for him at the cemetery by a few of his fellow hunting buddies. There's something in my eye.

<!--
My cousin pointed out that the roses were one of my uncle's favorite colors.

I think you are taking after me.

### Eclipse

On my way back to Plano after my uncle's funeral, I got stuck in eclipse travel. I arrived back in Plano in time for the eclipse, but hadn't had time to plan. Fortunately, JPMorganChase had me covered. Eclipse glasses were handed out around campus, and we convened outside for a watch party. It's hard to put into words what it was like to watch the eclipse with what must have been thousands of co-workers. At the moment of eclipse, as Total Eclipse of the Heart played on the loudspeaker, a cheer went up across the crowd.

### Lemurs at Tanganyka Wildlife Park

Because our DjangoCon US host city Durham, North Carolina has the largest population of lemurs outside of Madagascar, we featured a "friendly" lemur on our website last year.

A friendly lemur with a smile on its face

After years of hearing about [Tanganyika Wildlife Park](https://twpark.com/) in Goddard, Kansas, mom and I decided to go. I had no idea until I got there that you can feed lemurs. They were so soft and gentle. I loved spending time with these real-life, friendly lemurs!
