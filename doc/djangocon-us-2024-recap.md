## Intro

Disclaimer: the content of this post is a reflection of my career journey and not specific to my work at JPMorganChase.

DjangoCon US 2024 took place from September 22-27 in Durham, North Carolina at the Durhan Convention Center. It was the seventh DjangoCon US I've had the privilege of attending and an absolute blast!

### Venue Selection

If you want to bring DjangoCon US to your city or volunteer, we want to hear from you! 

My fellow DEFNA Board Member Adam Fast gave a lightning talk about our search for a venue for 2025 and beyond. Cost continues to be a challenge and our sponsorship is down.  

As they say in open source, "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." Perhaps with the eyeballs of the entire community, we can find an acceptable course of action.

### DjangoCon US Website and Design

A number of people commented that they really loved the t-shirt and bag this year. 

Our wonderful designer Joni Trythall of YupGup did a [DjangoCon US Design Reflection](https://jonitrythall.com/dcus-design-reflection) featuring all of our designs since 2018. 

As a DEFNA Board Member, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with Joni in bringing all of these designs to life. They are so beautiful!

Thank you to Joni for a special shoutout at the end of her post. 

In addition, we did a refactor of our DjangoCon US website backend this year. It's easier to get up and running and has a well documented style guide. 

Feel free to fork it and use it in line with the license. 

## Pre-Conference Activities

### Sightseeing and Some Great Meals

I feel privileged to be able to travel. I make the most of every opportunity to get to know a place better: seeing the unique sights, experiencing what makes the culture special, and enjoying the celebrated local cuisine. 

In Durham, I had the chance to revisit the incredible Sarah P. Duke Gardens and see a few other attractions for the first time. Also, although most of my meals were provided through the conference, I enjoyed some outstanding meals in downtown Durham restaurants. 
  
Here are a few of my favorite moments from the trip. See more photos and anecdotes later in this post. 

Sarah P. Duke Gardens Red Bridge... jaw dropping scenes

21c Museum Hotel... the bathroom window is transparent until you turn the lock, then it becomes opaque
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/21c-museum-hotel-bathroom.jpg)

The Durham Hotel lobby... wow!
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/the-durham-hotel-lobby.jpg)

Mother and Sons... Squid Ink Tonnarelli, NC Shrimp, uni, fennel, scallions
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/mother-and-sons-squid-ink-pasta.jpg)

Press Coffee, Crepes, and Cocktails... oh my, this berries crepe was absolutely delicious. I had a banana bread latte too that was chef's kiss.

### Black Python Devs Leadership Summit

It was an honor to have been invited to attend the [Black Python Devs Leadership Summit](https://blackpythondevs.com/leadership-summit-2024/) as a distinguished guest. 

The event took place at the Caktus office. I attended the afternoon session. 

The session kicked off with a keynote by Wesley Faulkner. 

Wesley gave some sobering stats, then gave practical advice for how to observe, predict, and improve your surroundings, the benefits and risks.

Interactive speakers
* Loren Crary (filling in for Tim Schilling): PSF
* Afi Gbadago: BPD Open Source Program
* Kudzayi Bamhare: Creating ecosystems- conducting a beginner Python workshop in Zimbabwe in partnership with Uncommon teaching hub

BPD Vice-Executor Velda Kiara led a panel with with community leaders about topics concerning Black Leaders in Python.

Panel participants Benedict Koji Amofah, Jeff Triplett, Loren Crary, Monica Oyugi, and host Velda Kiara
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/black-python-devs-summit-panel.jpg)

After the panel, we took part in breakout sessions. My group had a thoughtful and spirited conversation about newcomer psychological safety moderated by Alex Oladele and Paul Everitt.

The event ended with a fun happy hour. 

Me, Abigail Afi Gbadago, and Velda Kiara after the summit!

I am so proud of them for the role they played in organizing an outstanding event. It had a lot of heart.

BPF Founder Jay Miller announced that the next leadership summit will be somewhere in Africa. 

The morning and afternoon replays are available on the info page. 

### Rooftop View of Durham

After the summit, a DjangoCon US attendee who lives at One City Center took a group of us up to the 28th floor for an incredible view of the Durham skyline.

### Django Social

For the second year in a row, Foxley Talent spearheaded a Django Social event at [Ponysaurus Brewing Company](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/). Thank you to REVSYS for sponsoring as well. 

A sign of a fantastic event: it was over before I knew it. I had the chance to catch up with "old" friends and meet new ones.

[Choosing Wisely: SPA vs. HTMX for Your Next Web Project](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/choosing-wisely-spa-vs-htmx-for-your-next-web-project/) by Chris May

My points of interest
* Last year's talk introduced idea that you can have SPA-like experience in Django using tools other than typical SPA tools like HTMX
* Why would I want to use HTMX versus SPA?
* Are you using a SPA? What would make you change? When do you think you should use a SPA? What tools are you favorite tools? Are you using them well?

[Error Culture](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/error-culture/) by Ryan Cheley

My points of interest
* Automated alerts received via email
* Error culture: workers ignore error notifications, creating a culture of reactive firefighting
* Why does it happen? Lack of understanding: what, why, who; error/alert fatique, hero culture
* [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/)
* Is the alert important? No: don't just delete the alert. Delete the mechanism that created the alert.
* Is the alert important? Yes: Is the alert actionable? What does an actionable alert look like?
* It has a verb
* Examples

### Shrimp and Grits

I tried grits as a kid and didn't like them. I've recently been told by friends that I just haven't had the right grits. 

When I saw grits on the DjangoCon US lunch buffet, I had to try them. I still don't like them, but it was an experience! 

North Carolina-inspired lunch

### DEFNA Board Dinner

DEFNA had a board dinner to discuss business. It was a pleasure to be treated to a gourmet meal at 21c Museum Hotel [Counting House](https://countinghousenc.com/) restaurant. 

I had oysters for the first time and particularly enjoyed the scallops and smoked trout dip. 

The DEFNA Board... wonderful people!

## Tuesday

### Tuesday Morning Talks

[Keynote - How To Be A Developer and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-tuesday/) by Mario Munoz

My points of interest
* I agree that Velda and Mario both have great hair :)
* "I am a person."
* "We all know philosophy and software engineering are the same thing." Abstract thinking, making models of intangible things, trying to apply them to real world scenarios.
* Jacques Lacan- Mirror Stage
* 12 Monkeys Steam Punk Lab
* "Being a developer should in no way rob you of who you are and your own identity"
* Person/Ality personality simulator
* "The biggest lie that we can tell ourselves is that these objects of representation that are outside of us are synonymous with who we are."
* "Everything we tell ourselves about ourselves is always a little bit inadequate"
* "Our strengths can also be our biggest weaknesses." Examples. "You can also turn your weaknesses into your strengths."
* Far greater things... "I am a community. We are a community... The community is my biggest asset."
* "How to be a better developer... be a better person to others." 

[Seamless Transition: How I Converted an Existing MySQL Database to be Fully Managed by Django Migrations Framework](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/seamless-transition-how-i-converted-an-existing-mysql-database-to-be-fully-managed-by-django-migrations-framework/) by Daniel Ramas

My points of interest
* MySQL
* Django migrations flow
* We have the ability to run custom Python scripts using RunPython
* Common arguments: Apps and schema_editor
* Another common migration class: RunSQL (caution: accepts strings of SQL commands to run on the database; sanitize inputs and beware SQL injection)
* Pattern: migrations have a dependency to the previous migration that is applied before it. This is how Django links migrations and is able to create a tree to describe what the migrations history looks like
* Other way of creating a dependency, create a ForeignKey relationship
* Sync an existing database to Django, Docker Compose
* Take note of the type of primary key fields, primary keys are primarily integers
* DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD: AutoField is a subclass of IntegerField
* Use inspectdb to generate the models based on schema it can detect: python manage.py inspectdb > <file_structure>
* Why did he delete models?
* class Meta managed=True
* makemigrations
* python manage.py migrate --fake (will fake all migrations that need to be applied)
* python manage.py migrate --fake-initial (multiple migrations need to be run, but only initial migration needs to be faked)
* ForeignKeys that are enforced on the backend not the database
* db_column
* Custom migration
* Use RunPython to do the cleaning of the columns
* apps.get_model
* Operation can't be reversed, so don't need a reverse function
* AlterField

[PostgreSQL Beyond Django: Strategies to Get Max Performance](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/postgresql-beyond-django-strategies-to-get-max-performance/) by Álvaro Justen

My points of interest

* Docker Compose web and db service
* psycopg, postreSQL, rows library

* Brasil.IO dataset Manifesto
* First implementation: lazy
* TBC

[Django + Alpine.js + htmx Ups & Downs](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/django-alpine-js-htmx-ups-downs/) by Karen Tracey

My points of interest
* North Carolina Outerbanks Nags Head
* The promise of a sunny day
* Overlap between frontend frameworks and Django
* The frontend frameworks would expect that instead of sending HTML, the server would be sending JSON. And the frontend frameworks would take the JSON and turn that into HTML.
* Lack of full stack
* "We're all on a walk on the beach"
* Karen would like to encourage sharing of information.

### Meeting Lorenzo

After years of following each other on social media, Lorenzo Peña and I had the chance to meet in person! I was thrilled that he had the chance to present a talk [The art of (not) redirecting](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/the-art-of-not-redirecting/) and attend the speaker/organizer dinner too.

### Speaker and Organizer Dinner

On Tuesday night, I attended the speaker/organizer dinner at [Greer Street Garden](https://geerstreetgarden.com/about). 

It was a chance to relax, enjoy some good food and conversation. 

Sitting next to Simon Willison, co-creator of Django, I couldn't resist getting a photo!

I wrote about Simon's PyCon US 2024 talk about Imitation Intelligence in my [PyCon US Recap](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/pycon-us-2024-recap.html#simon-willison-keynote).

### Lightning Talk Cameo

It's no secret that I've been using social media for networking for many years now. Foxley Talent's Jon Gould and I had a conversation about it. Jon was inspired to create a lightning talk about the subject entitled Coffee Break Career Hacks and featured my social media engagement. It was an honor to be included!

### Panel Discussion: Open, friendly, and welcoming: on the history and future of mentoring in Django

Our conference ended with a panel of five women, including three women of color, and Carlton Gibson. They owned that stage and the crowd was totally absorbed with what they had to say. I'm proud to be part of a community that is making substantial progress and quickly at that.

### Queeny's 

After the conference had ended, I joined a group of Wagtail developers and Eva Nanyonga and walked the short distance to [Queeny's](https://www.queenysdurham.com/), a DjangoCon US institution. No one ever seems to turn down dinner at Queeny's. :)

### Connections Made

I chatted with Thibaud Colas about his sustainability talk and got some tips from him. 

I listened in on a conversation with Lee Trout and Adam Fast and learned about some new tools. 

I pointed out Chris May's HTMX talk to Philip, a UI developer. He didn't know about HTMX and found it very enlightening. 

I chatted with Jay Miller about how DEFNA could better serve Black Python Devs and reported feedback. 

I found out from Frank Wiles that there is some early talk about a possible Lawrence Django event. 

I chatted with Simon Willison about some of my work duties, and he identified them as senior level. He told me about his excitement for his upcoming trip to see the [V & E Simonetti Historic Tuba Collection](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/v-e-simonetti-historic-tuba-collection).

I spent some much needed quality time with Lacey Henschel. She told me that I can learn anything. :) 

I met Django Fellow Sarah Boyce for the first time. We chatted about her work and DjangoCon Europe. In addition to her DjangoCon US talk, Sarah recently gave an excellent talk [Django Core Demystified](https://youtu.be/8rIylYYCmSI?si=8RsuP6VX41mVS0p6). 

I connected Thibaud with myself, Nicole, and Peter to talk about DjangoCon US website improvements and using it for other conference sites.

### Visa Frustration

As our conference becomes more diverse, a common frustration has emerged: difficulty getting a visa to enter the US. People from multiple countries have voiced their frustration about this to me. Django community member Julius Boakye poured his heart into a must-read post about it: [Breaking Barriers: A Tech Speaker’s Plea for Fair Visa Policies](https://medium.com/@theflyboy/breaking-barriers-a-tech-speakers-plea-for-fair-visa-policies-621b5909e496).

## Thursday

### Sprints

Caktus office around the corner from the Marriott is the perfect sprint venue. 

Me and Carlton
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/me-and-carlton.jpg)

I was racking my brain to figure out what to eat for lunch. I joined a group and walked the short distance to [Pie Pushers](https://www.piepushers.com/). 

A slice of Italian sausage and a simple house salad really hit the spot! It was the best tasting pizza I've had in quite a while.

### Sarah P. Duke Gardens

For months, I had been looking forward to making it back to the [Sarah P. Duke Gardens](https://gardens.duke.edu/). It is "the Cadillac" of botanical gardens with jaw dropping scenes everywhere. It's also said to be a different garden with every new season or even new month. I'd visit Durham again just to go back.

### Cocoa Cinnamon

I love [Cocoa Cinnamon](https://littlewaves.coffee/pages/old-north-durham) coffee shop. I first tried it last year and went back several times during DjangoCon US 2024. I don't just love it for the coffee, which is amazing, by the way. On my first visit this year, I was offered a free Chai Latte. As I sat drinking it, they offered a free coffee that was redeemed by a student sitting studying. According to their menu, they also offer reduced price coffees as a service to the community. It's nice to patronize a business that shows kindness. 

Drinks had:
* Chai Latte: "Housemade chai blend of cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, rose, anise, & black pepper served unsweetened or with honey or vanilla syrup"
* Caramelo: "Sweet & creamy latte with with dulce de leche named for Sandra Cisneros' novel" 
* Al Mohka: "Latte with 70% single origin housemade chocolate sauce & cinnamon. Reference to first ever coffee port"

Yum!

### The Can Opener

I acted on a tip from fellow DEFNA Board Member Drew Winstel and visited The Can Opener. 

Built in the 1940s when vehicles weren't as large, [The Can Opener](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/truck-decapitating-bridge), a railroad trestle bridge, was a mere 11 feet, 8 inches tall until 8 inches were added in 2019. Even with this improvement and warning signs well in advance, the bridge continues to peel the tops off trucks.

### 21c Museum Hotel

Last year, I didn't make it to the [21c Museum Hotel](https://www.21cmuseumhotels.com/) to see the hotel's signature artwork, so I thought it would be a fun experience this year. I was particularly taken by the see-into bathrooms. Also, the bank vault was a fun throwback to the hotel's past as a bank. 

[Video of 21c Museum Hotel See Into Bathroom](https://youtu.be/yeOEAycUvIQ)

### The Durham Hotel

I went to [The Durham Hotel](https://www.thedurham.com/roof/), because I heard it has the best public view of the Durham skyline in town. I later had a much higher view of the skyline from the private 28th floor of One City Center, but The Durham Hotel architecture and interior design were well worth a visit in their own right.

### Mother and Sons

I'd been hungry for good Italian food for a while. [Mother and Sons](https://www.mothersandsonsnc.com/) had very high ratings, so I decided to give it a try. 

I'd planned to play it safe and order the potato gnocchi. I asked the waiter if there was a particular dish that was very popular. He said the squid ink tonnarelli. I told him I'd always wondered what squid ink pasta tasted like, but had been afraid to order it. He said that the squid ink taste was mild. So, I ordered it, and it delicious. It had a lemon-butter shrimp taste.

### Durham Food Hall

I'd already eaten, but joined a few attendees to walk over to the [Durham Food Hall](https://durhamfoodhall.com/) so they could eat. It was a thriving place with a lot of great options. 

Looking down at the first floor of the food hall

### Press Coffee, Crepes, and Cocktails

I love [Press Coffee, Crepes, and Cocktails](https://pressccc.com/). It's a short walk south of the downtown and well worth it. It's a coffeehouse specializing in savory and sweet crepes. The space has a bright, energectic vibe and the food and coffee are very high quality.   

First time eating avocado toast... I went big! This was gourmet quality, for sure. The seasonal salted pistachio mocha latte was to die for.

### Centerfest

Serendipitiously, an art festival called [Centerfest](https://durhamarts.org/centerfest/) was taking place on Saturday and Sunday. 

I wandered through the art booths, then stumbled upon one of many musical acts. It was called Heart of Carolina A Capella. It was fun! 

[Video of Heart of Carolina A Capella singing Sweet Caroline](https://youtu.be/89tf1KyUjGs)

<sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>

### Durham Market Culture

It's wonderful to see Durham's thriving market and festival culture. In addition to Centerfest, I stumbled upon the [Durham Farmers' Market](https://www.durhamfarmersmarket.com/), [Durham Craft Market](https://durhamcentralpark.org/events/durham-craft-market/), and [Durham Underground Market](https://makrs.com/durham-underground-market) all in the same weekend. 

On Sunday, I was looking for a quick, tasty lunch and decided to try the fare of a [Durham Underground Market](https://makrs.com/durham-underground-market) food truck. 

[Cousins Maine Lobster](https://www.cousinsmainelobster.com/) piqued my interest. According to the truck, the founders had appeared on Shark Tank. 

I ordered a lobster tail, but they were out, so they upgraded me to a lobster roll and tots. It was my first time eating a lobster roll. It was tasty! 

This was the moment when I realized my low cholesterol diet was officially suspended

### Unscripted Rooftop Pool

I had the chance to spend time at the [Unscripted Hotel](https://www.unscriptedhotels.com/). The rooftop overlooks the downtown and features a pool, bar, and DJ. It was an unforgettable atmosphere. 

[Video of the Unscripted rooftop pool](https://youtu.be/_5-08ssL8Wk)

### The Parlour

I made a trip to [The Parlour](https://theparlour.co/) for the second year in a row. Last year, I had chocolate and was underwhelmed. This year, I had their most popular flavor- Salted Butter Caramel. It was truly incredible. I hope to make it back to Durham someday and visit The Parlour again!
