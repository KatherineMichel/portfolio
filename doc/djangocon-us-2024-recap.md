## Intro

Disclaimer: the content of this post is a reflection of my career journey and not specific to my work at JPMorganChase.

DjangoCon US 2024 took place from September 22-27 in Durham, North Carolina. It was the seventh DjangoCon US I've had the privilege of attending and an absolute blast! 

If you want to bring DjangoCon US to your city or volunteer, we want to hear from you! 

Fellow Board Member Adam Fast gave a lightning talk about our search for a venue for 2025 and beyond. Cost continues to be a challenge. As they say in open source, "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." Perhaps with the eyeballs of the entire community, we can find an acceptable course of action.

## Pre-Conference Activities

### Sightseeing and Some Great Meals

I feel privileged to be able to travel. I make the most of every opportunity to get to know a place better: seeing the unique sights, experiencing what makes the culture special, and enjoying the celebrated local cuisine. 

In Durham, I had the chance to revisit the incredible Sarah P. Duke Gardens and see a few other attractions for the first time. Also, although most of my meals were provided through the conference, I enjoyed some outstanding meals in downtown Durham restaurants. 

A few favorite moments
* Trying avocado toast, squid ink pasta, lobster roll, and oysters for the first time
* Being treated to a gourmet meal at 21c Museum Hotel at the DEFNA Board Dinner
* Getting a photo in front of a butterfly artwork

### Black Python Devs Leadership Summit

It was an honor to have been invited to attend the [Black Python Devs Leadership Summit](https://blackpythondevs.com/leadership-summit-2024/) as a distinguished guest.

I am so proud of them for the role they played in organizing an outstanding event. It had a lot of heart.

### Rooftop View of Durham

After the summit, a DjangoCon US attendee who lives at One City Center took a group of us up to the 28th floor for an incredible view of the Durham skyline.

### Swag Stuffing

On Sunday, I continued my tradition of swag stuffing. Conference pro-tip: it's a great opportunity to meet people!

### Django Social

For the second year in a row, Foxley Talent spearheaded a Django Social event at [Ponysaurus Brewing Company](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/). 

A sign of a fantastic event: it was over before I knew it. I had the chance to catch up with "old" friends and meet new ones.

### Shrimp and Grits

I tried grits as a kid and didn't like them. I've recently been told by friends that I just haven't had the right grits. 

When I saw grits on the DjangoCon US lunch buffet, I had to try them. I still don't like them, but it was an experience!

### DEFNA Board Dinner

DEFNA had a board dinner to discuss business. It was a pleasure to be treated to a gourmet meal at 21c Museum Hotel [Counting House](https://countinghousenc.com/) restaurant. 

I had oysters for the first time and particularly enjoyed the scallops and smoked trout dip. 

The DEFNA Board... wonderful people!

### Meeting Lorenzo

After years of following each other on social media, Lorenzo Pe√±a and I had the chance to meet in person! It was wonderful to hear about his dream trip to DjangoCon US. 

Lorenzo's social media post
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/lorenzo-post.png)

I was thrilled that he had the chance to present a talk [The art of (not) redirecting](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/the-art-of-not-redirecting/) and attend the speaker/organizer dinner too. 

Me and Lorenzo

### Speaker and Organizer Dinner

On Tuesday night, I attended the speaker/organizer dinner at [Greer Street Garden](https://geerstreetgarden.com/about). 

It was a chance to relax, enjoy some good food and conversation. 

Sitting next to Simon Willison, co-creator of Django, I couldn't resist getting a photo!

I wrote about Simon's PyCon US 2024 talk about Imitation Intelligence in my [PyCon US Recap](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/pycon-us-2024-recap.html#simon-willison-keynote).

### The Boxcar Bar and Arcade

After the speaker/organizer dinner, [Six Feet Up](https://www.sixfeetup.com/) hosted a Mario Kart competition across the street at [The Boxcar Bar and Arcade](https://theboxcarbar.com/). 

I spotted a few favorite old school games too: Super Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, BurgerTime, Frogger.

### Visa Frustration

As our conference becomes more diverse, a common frustration has emerged: difficulty getting a visa to enter the US. People from multiple countries have voiced their frustration about this to me. Django community member Julius Boakye poured his heart into a must-read post about it: [Breaking Barriers: A Tech Speaker‚Äôs Plea for Fair Visa Policies](https://medium.com/@theflyboy/breaking-barriers-a-tech-speakers-plea-for-fair-visa-policies-621b5909e496).

Caktus offices around the corner from the Marriott are the perfect sprint venue.

I was racking brain to figure out what to eat for lunch. I joined a group and walked the short distance to [Pie Pushers](https://www.piepushers.com/). 

A slice of Italian susage and a simple house salad really hit the spot! It was the best tasting pizza I've had in quite a while.

### Sarah P. Duke Gardens

For months, I had been looking forward to making it back to the [Sarah P. Duke Gardens](https://gardens.duke.edu/). It is "the Cadillac" of botanical gardens with jaw dropping scenes everywhere. It's also said to be a different garden with every new season or even new month. I'd visit Durham again just to go back.

### Cocoa Cinnamon

I love [Cocoa Cinnamon](https://littlewaves.coffee/pages/old-north-durham) coffee shop. I first tried it last year and went back several times during DjangoCon US. I don't just love it for the coffee, which is amazing, by the way. On my first visit this year, I was offered a free Chai Latte. As I sat drinking it, they offered a free coffee that was redeemed by a student sitting studying. According to their menu, they also offer reduced price coffees as a service to the community. It's nice to patronize a business that shows kindness. 

Drinks had:
* Chai Latte: "Housemade chai blend of cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, rose, anise, & black pepper served unsweetened or with honey or vanilla syrup"
* Caramelo: "Sweet & creamy latte with with dulce de leche named for Sandra Cisneros' novel" 
* Al Mohka: "Latte with 70% single origin housemade chocolate sauce & cinnamon. Reference to first ever coffee port"

Cocoa Cinnamon... a short walk from the convention center

Yum!

### The Can Opener

I acted on a tip from fellow DEFNA Board Member Drew Winstel and visited The Can Opener. 

Build in the 1940s when vehicles weren't as large, [The Can Opener](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/truck-decapitating-bridge), a railroad trestle bridge, was a mere 11 feet, 8 inches tall until 8 inches were added in 2019. Even with this improvement and warning signs well in advance, the bridge continues to peel the tops off trucks.

### 21c Museum Hotel

Last year, I didn't make it ot the [21c Museum Hotel](https://www.21cmuseumhotels.com/) to see the artwork, so I thought it would be a fun experience this year. The hotel is filled with artwork. I was particularly taken by the see-into bathrooms, and the bank vault was a fun throwback to the hotel's past as a bank.

### The Durham Hotel

I went to [The Durham Hotel](https://www.thedurham.com/roof/), because I heard it has the best public view of the Durham skyline in town. I later had a much higher view of the skyline from the private 28th floor of One City Center, but The Durham Hotel architecture and interior design were well worth a visit in their own right.  

Wow! I love this lobby.

### Press Coffee, Crepes,and Cocktails

I love [Press Coffee, Crepes, and Cocktails](https://pressccc.com/). It's a short walk south of the downtown and well worth it. It's a coffeehouse specializing in savory and sweet crepes. The space has a bright, energectic vibe and the food and coffee are very high quality.   

First time eating avocado toast... I went big! This was gourmet quality, for sure. The seasonal salted pistachio mocha latte was to die for. 
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/press-crepe-company-avocado-toast.jpg)

Oh my, this berries crepe was absolutely delicious. I had a banana bread latte too that was chef's kiss.

### Durham Underground Market

I was looking for a quick, tasty lunch and stumbled upon the [Durham Underground Market](https://makrs.com/durham-underground-market) food trucks. 

[Cousins Maine Lobster](https://www.cousinsmainelobster.com/) piqued my interest. According to the truck, the founders had appeared on Shark Tank. 

I ordered a lobster tail, but they were out, so they upgraded me to a lobster roll and tots. It was my first time eating a lobster roll. It was tasty! 

This was the moment when I realized my low cholesterol diet was officially suspended

I had the chance to spend time at the [Unscripted Hotel](https://www.unscriptedhotels.com/). The rooftop overlooks the downtown and features a pool, bar, and DJ. It was an unforgettable atmosphere.

### The Parlour

I made a trip to [The Parlour](https://theparlour.co/) for the second year in a row. Last year, I had chocolate and was underwhelmed. This year, I had their most popular flavor- Salted Butter Caramel. It was truly incredible. Hope to make it back to Durham someday and visit The Parlour again!
