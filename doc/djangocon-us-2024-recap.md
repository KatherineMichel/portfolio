## Intro

Disclaimer: the content of this post is a reflection of my career journey and not specific to my work at JPMorganChase.

DjangoCon US 2024 took place from September 22-27 in Durham, North Carolina at the Durhan Convention Center. It was the seventh DjangoCon US I've had the privilege of attending and an absolute blast!

### Venue Selection

If you want to bring DjangoCon US to your city or volunteer, we want to hear from you! 

My fellow DEFNA Board Member Adam Fast gave a lightning talk about our search for a venue for 2025 and beyond. Cost continues to be a challenge and our sponsorship is down.  

As they say in open source, "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." Perhaps with the eyeballs of the entire community, we can find an acceptable course of action.

### DjangoCon US Website and Design

A number of people have commented that they've really loved the t-shirt and bag this year. 

Our wonderful designer Joni Trythall of YupGup did a [DjangoCon US Design Reflection](https://jonitrythall.com/dcus-design-reflection) featuring all of our designs since 2018. 

As a DEFNA Board Member, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with Joni in bringing all of these designs to life. They are so beautiful!

Thank you to Joni for a special shoutout at the end of her post. 

In addition, we did a refactor of our DjangoCon US website backend this year. It's easier to get up and running and has a well documented style guide. 

Feel free to fork it and use it in line with the license. 

## Pre-Conference Activities

### Sightseeing and Some Great Meals

I feel privileged to be able to travel. I make the most of every opportunity to get to know a place better: seeing the unique sights, experiencing what makes the culture special, and enjoying the celebrated local cuisine. 

In Durham, I had the chance to revisit the incredible Sarah P. Duke Gardens and see a few other attractions for the first time. Also, although most of my meals were provided through the conference, I enjoyed some outstanding meals in downtown Durham restaurants. 
  
Here are a few of my favorite moments from the trip. See more photos and anecdotes later in this post. 

Sarah P. Duke Gardens Red Bridge... jaw dropping scenes

### Black Python Devs Leadership Summit

It was an honor to have been invited to attend the [Black Python Devs Leadership Summit](https://blackpythondevs.com/leadership-summit-2024/) as a distinguished guest. 

The event took place at the Caktus office. I attended the afternoon session. 

The session kicked off with a keynote by Wesley Faulkner. 

Wesley gave some sobering stats, then gave practical advice for how to observe, predict, and improve your surroundings, the benefits and risks.

![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/tech-sector-stats-2.png)

Interactive speakers
* Loren Crary (filling in for Tim Schilling): PSF
* Afi Gbadago: BPD Open Source Program
* Kudzayi Bamhare: Creating ecosystems- conducting a beginner Python workshop in Zimbabwe in partnership with Uncommon teaching hub

BPD Vice-Executor Velda Kiara led a panel with with community leaders about topics concerning Black Leaders in Python.

Panel participants Benedict Koji Amofah, Jeff Triplett, Loren Crary, Monica Oyugi, and host Velda Kiara

After the panel, we took part in breakout sessions. My group had a thoughtful and spirited conversation about newcomer psychological safety moderated by Alex Oladele and Paul Everitt.

The event ended with a fun happy hour. 

Me, Abigail Afi Gbadago, and Velda Kiara after the summit!

I am so proud of them for the role they played in organizing an outstanding event. It had a lot of heart.

BPD Founder Jay Miller announced that the next leadership summit will be somewhere in Africa. 

The morning and afternoon replays are available on the info page. 

### Rooftop View of Durham

After the summit, a DjangoCon US attendee who lives at One City Center took a group of us up to the 28th floor for an incredible view of the Durham skyline.

### Django Social

For the second year in a row, Foxley Talent spearheaded a Django Social event at [Ponysaurus Brewing Company](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/). Thank you to REVSYS for sponsoring as well. 

A sign of a fantastic event: it was over before I knew it. I had the chance to catch up with "old" friends and meet new ones.

## Monday

Orientation Chair Kojo Idressa and Conference Chair and DEFNA President Peter Grandstaff kicked off the conference. 

### Keynote - Power to the People who Teach the People by Sheena O'Connell

Sheena is interested in [metacognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition) or how people learn. 

She talked about common learning anti-patterns, what a normal classroom looks like, and normal success distribution. 

She introduced [Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem). "The average student tutored one-to-one using mastery learning techniques performed two standard deviations better than students educated in a classroom environment."

Mastery-learning techniques
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/sheena-mastery-learning-techniques.png)

A few advantages of mastery-based learning:
* Social contract- students are more motivated due to buy-in
* It helps students develop a growth mindset 
* It helps the teacher master teaching ("did I do a good job of teaching?")

A few thoughts on learning
* The power of compounding over time
* If you teach one person, it can impact many others
* Struggle is good, teach students how to learn
* Some teaching techniques are more powerful than others
* "Trust no one"
* "You can't each a person to ride a bicycle by riding a bicycle for them."

"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire."

Sheena has started [The Guild of Educators](https://www.sheenaoc.com/articles/2024-09-12-introducing-goe).

### Choosing Wisely: SPA vs. HTMX for Your Next Web Project by Chris May

Last year, in his talk HTML-ivating your Django web app‚Äôs experience with HTMX, AlpineJS, and streaming HTML, Chris introduced the idea that you can have a SPA-like exerience in Django without using SPA tools. 

I wrote about it in my [DjangoCon US 2023 Recap](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/djangocon-us-2023-recap.html#html-ivating-your-django-web-app-s-experience-with-htmx-alpinejs-and-streaming-html). 

In that talk, he referenced a Thoughtworks article [SPA by Default](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar/techniques/spa-by-default) and Tayor Hunt's [Making the World's Fastest Website and Other Mistakes](https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na)

According to Thoughtworks, "Too often teams are skipping [that] trade-off analysis, blindly accepting the complexity of SPAs by default even when business needs don't justify it."

Taylor Hunt refactored a React/Redux grocery store SPA app for a much improved experience by using just HTML, CSS, and laser-focused JavaScript. 

Chris started this year's talk off by asking some questions: Are you using a SPA? What would make you change? When do you think you should use a SPA? Why would I want to use HTMX versus SPA? What tools are you favorite tools? Are you using them well?

SPA downsides
* Slow startup time
* Bad user experience on slow devices
* "A massive investment in controlling complexity is the only way to scale JS-driven frontends." Alex Russell in [The Market for Lemons](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/)
* "Not only does JavaScript cost 3x more in processing power, byte-for-byte, than HTML and CSS, but it also removes the browser's ability to parallelise page loading." Alex Russell in [Caprock](https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/)
* "When using JavaScript you pay a performance tax no less than four times." Tim Kadlec in [The Cost of JavaScript Frameworks](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks)

How the front-end is coping
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/chris-how-the-frontend-is-coping.png)

When SPAs could be worth their weight (Alex Russell in [Caprock](https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/))
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/chris-when-spas-could-be-worth-their-weight.png)

When or when-not to SPA (Alex Russell in [Caprock](https://infrequently.org/2024/08/caprock/))
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/chris-specrum.png)

Chris pointed out [Katie Sylor-Miller's "Component Islands" pattern](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) as showing promise. "Removing the need for a root JavaScript component greatly reduces complexity." The brower can handle most things without JavaScript." 

Streamed HTML Components
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/chris-streamed-html-components.png)

Chris introduced tools that can be used to create a SPA-like experience
* CSS view transitions
* [Django Unicorn](https://www.django-unicorn.com/)
* HTMX
* Alpine.js
* [django-template-partials](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-template-partials)
* [django-components](https://pypi.org/project/django-components/)
* [Datastar](https://datastar.fly.dev/)
* [Unpoly](https://unpoly.com/) 

Three HTMX success stories
* [Umuzi](https://www.sheenaoc.com/articles/2024-06-30-htmx)
* [contexte](https://david.guillot.me/en/posts/tech/following-up-mother-of-all-htmx-demos/)
* [OpenUnited](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109116330770878464/)

Notably, OpenUnited developer velocity improved by at least 500% after switching to HTMX. 
  
Chris will follow up with a blog post with more info about streaming HTML components.

### Error Culture by Ryan Cheley

Ryan defined Error Culture: workers ignore automated email alerts, creating a culture of reactive firefighting. 

Why does it happen? Lack of understanding, error/alert fatigue, hero culture. 

If an alert is not important: don't just delete the alert. Delete the mechanism that created the alert. 

Make sure an alert is... actionable, important, sent to the right people

### Shrimp and Grits

I tried grits as a kid and didn't like them. I've recently been told by friends that I just haven't had the right grits. 

When I saw grits on the DjangoCon US lunch buffet, I had to try them. I still don't like them, but it was an experience!

### Troubleshooting is a Lifestyle üòé by Jack Linke

Jack started off the talk with a quote and described indicator categories. 

"If your only tool is a hammer then everything looks like a nail." Abraham Maslow

Jack started with some Django built-in troubleshooting tools
* Django template error pages
* Django error reporting by email
* Django system checks framework (it's extensible- dj-stripe is an example)
* Django console and logging (for extra context and use verbosity settings 1-3)

Django System Checks Framework
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/jack-django-systems-check-framework.png)

He then moved on to some third-party packages and tools
* django-debug-toolbar (also extensible)
* django-silk performance profiler
* Error tracking and performance monitoring- Sentry, Rollbar, Newrelic, Honeybadger, Bugsnag, Raygun
* He gave a demo of Sentry dashboard with error page, error message, tags
* django-health-check package (can add Celery, Redis, Postgres)
* django-watchman

He gave an exemple of extending the Django admin by adding checks. He had an issue with Celery- too few tasks were processed. He put a panel into the admin to capture the last 24 hours of tasks processed through Celery. 

Strategies for dissecting complex issues
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/jack-strategies-for-dissecting-complex-issues.png)

He then gave some general tips for troubleshooting
* Use the power of isolating variables and narrowing scope
* Be like Frances Elizabeth Holberton- "break the execution- does the system work up to this point." Similarly, Python Debugger (PDB) can be used to create breakpoints to step through the code to find the issue. 
* Avoid tunnel vision- seek broad pespectives and alternative approaches

Troushooting often involves stating the problem and asking for help
* "A problem well stated is a problem half solved." John Dewey
* Rubber duck debugging
* Know when to seek assistance
* Asking for help is a strategy. Learn how to ask for help effectively
* Learn how to create a Minimum Reproducible Example (MRE) to increase your odds of getting help

How to effectively ask for help
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/jack-how-to-effectively-ask-for-help.png)

Oh no
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/jack-oh-no.png)

Yep!
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/jack-yep.png)

Where to get help
![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/jack-where-to-get-help.png)

Jack gave a shout out to Ken Whitesell for his prolific question-answering in the Django Forum!

Jack encouraged the audience to document your process.

### A Related Matter: Optimizing your webapp by using django-debug-toolbar, select_related(), and prefetch_related() by Christopher Adams

Because I am already familiar with diagnosing and fixing N+1 problems, I watched Christopher's talk for new ideas. 

A few reminders
* Querysets are immutable
* Querysets are lazy (they do not hit the database until they are evaluated). Chris showed examples. 

A few ways to profile SQL queries
* Set Django logging to debug and stream results
* DB all-statement logging (caution- this will fill up the logs, so perhaps run it for a minute or so in staging, not prod)
* [django-debug-toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (install conditionally)
  
Good points about select_related() and prefetch_related()
* Database transaction latency is increased if the data is in another datacenter
* Prefetch returns another queryset and this can be more efficient than if the database does it
* People in the 90th percentile who have a slow machine can benefit

Other django-debug-toolbar uses

### Unlocking Performance: Benchmarking and profiling Django for Maximum Efficiency by Ron Maravanyika

[Unlocking Performance: Benchmarking and profiling Django for Maximum Efficiency](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/unlocking-performance-benchmarking-and-profiling-django-for-maximum-efficiency/) by Ron Maravanyika

Ron said that firstly, we need to define effiency. 

Benchmarking is looking at time. Profiling is looking at resource usage. 

Ron explained some possible tools and gave demos
* Unix time command: real, user, sys
* Python timeit module
* [pytest-benchmark](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and benchmark_weave, aspectlib
* Python profile module
* Python cprofile module
* Live profiling tool [django-silk](https://github.com/jazzband/django-silk)
* django-silk profiler and binary version can be used to create an image that shows parallel functions running
* django-silk decorator method and context manager method can be used to profile small blocks of code
* django-silk [Dynamic profiling](https://github.com/jazzband/django-silk?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-profiling) can be used to profile something you don't have access to

### DEFNA Board Dinner

DEFNA had a board dinner to discuss business. It was a pleasure to be treated to a gourmet meal at 21c Museum Hotel [Counting House](https://countinghousenc.com/) restaurant. It was an unforgettable experience. 

I had oysters for the first time and particularly enjoyed the scallops and smoked trout dip. 

The DEFNA Board... wonderful people!

## Tuesday

### Keynote - How To Be A Developer and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves by Mario Munoz

Mario started off his keynote by introducing himself. "I am a person." He went on to talk about the diverse experiences that have contributed to who he is today. 

Mario's talk was philosophical. He acknowledged, "We all know philosophy and software engineering are the same thing." Both are involve abstract thinking, making models of intangible things, trying to apply them to real world scenarios. 

He talked about The Mirror Stage, a concept in Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory. It refers to the time when a child identifies their own image. 

Mario then used a Person/Ality personality simulator. Images, as though from the subconscious, appeared on the screen as he talked about experiences he'd had as a developer. Afterward, he analyzed each experience.  

![](djangocon-us-2024-recap-images/mario-withdrawn-mood-self-absorbed.png)

Throughout the talk, he reflected
* "Being a developer should in no way rob you of who you are and your own identity."
* "The biggest lie that we can tell ourselves is that these objects of representation that are outside of us are synonymous with who we are."
* "Everything we tell ourselves about ourselves is always a little bit inadequate."
* Our strengths can be our biggest weakness and our weaknesses can be turned into our strengths.

At the end, he revealed, "I am a community. We are a community... The community is my biggest asset."

"How to be a better developer... be a better person to others."

### Speaker and Organizer Dinner

On Tuesday night, I attended the speaker/organizer dinner at [Greer Street Garden](https://geerstreetgarden.com/about). 

It was a chance to relax, enjoy some good food and conversation. 

Sitting next to Simon Willison, co-creator of Django, I couldn't resist getting a photo!

I wrote about Simon's PyCon US 2024 talk about Imitation Intelligence in my [PyCon US Recap](https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/pycon-us-2024-recap.html#simon-willison-keynote).

### Lightning Talk Cameo

It's no secret that I've been using social media for networking for many years now. Foxley Talent's Jon Gould and I had a conversation about it. Jon was inspired to create a lightning talk about the subject entitled Coffee Break Career Hacks and featured my social media engagement. It was an honor to be included!

[Django & Celery: A love story of async proportions](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/django-celery-a-love-story-of-async-proportions/) by Hugo Bessa

My points of interest
* Django performance, Python is slow, not built to work with multi-thread
* Running operations in the background
* Requests should be processed quickly for a good user experience
* Celery: async task queue or job queue which is based on distributed messaging passing
* Separates async task execution from main app execution so that it doesn't run the same processes as Django runs
*

[API Maybe: Bootstrapping a Web Application circa 2024](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/api-maybe-bootstrapping-a-web-application-circa-2024/) by Carlton Gibson

My points of interest
* Blog and DjangoChat
* Paths: monitoring, evaluation, and learning for development and sustainability projects
* A year and a half in, busy bootstrapping, this talk is about that
* 2018: API first, API only?
* Backend with a REST API to consume with the JavaScript client of the moment
* 2024: "HTML over the wire" (HTMX, Turbo, Unpoly, and co.)
* 2024: something else changed, where did all the money go?
* Inflation that followed the pandemic, global supply chain crisis, Russia/Ukraine war
* Tech layoffs, can't "pick up a big bag of cash to pay for a multidisciplinary team to build the app from day one."
* Limited budget, limited time, Carlton was the only worker on the tech side
* By leveraging Django, you can get as much done as teams using more complex stacks
* "Django really shines exactly when the money is tight"
* Django is the framework for perfectionists with deadlines... "When these deadlines are financial, all the more so."
* "Django is the perfect framework for our post zero interest rate world.
* Locality of behavior, a way of assessing code. Everything you need to understand that code is in one place. Makes code easier to reason about, easier to maintain, easier to iterate on. 
* The idea came from Carson Gross and HTMX
* Tailwind CSS- you can embed in the HTML to control the styling rather than keeping that code in a CSS file
* Alpine.js- a rugged JavaScript-like framework that lets you define your component behaviors in your HTML rather than in a separate JavaScript file
* HTMX adds a small set of HTML traits that expand the power of HTMX, all again without leaving your HTML
* Neopolitan- his take on quick CRUD views
* django-template-partials
* Locality of behavior can help you go faster
* Locality of behavior is a starting point not a destination
* "Use your judgement as to when you sacrifice a bit of locality of behavior as your code scales to gain in maintainability. 
* Locality of benavior is a tool. It doesn't mean we abandon the good engineering practices we've learned since we were juniors.
* "Holding the line on locality of behavior can really pay dividends."
* Dry, separation of concerns, "but for everyone of those, there's a write it twice and three times refactor."
* Luke Plant: [Programming Mantras are Proverbs](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/programming-mantras-are-proverbs/)
* [Protected variations](https://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/protectedVariation.pdf)
* Code that is likely to change, by focusing on locality of behavior
* Violation of protected variations
*

[Django + Alpine.js + htmx Ups & Downs](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/django-alpine-js-htmx-ups-downs/) by Karen Tracey

My points of interest
* North Carolina Outerbanks Nags Head
* The promise of a sunny day
* Overlap between frontend frameworks and Django
* The frontend frameworks would expect that instead of sending HTML, the server would be sending JSON. And the frontend frameworks would take the JSON and turn that into HTML.
* Lack of full stack
* "We're all on a walk on the beach"
* Karen would like to encourage sharing of information.

### Panel Discussion: Open, friendly, and welcoming: on the history and future of mentoring in Django

Our conference ended with a panel of five women, including three women of color, and Carlton Gibson. They owned that stage and the crowd was totally absorbed with what they had to say. I'm proud to be part of a community that is making substantial progress and quickly at that.

### Queeny's 

After the conference had ended, I joined a group of Wagtail developers and conference speaker Eva Nanyonga and walked the short distance to [Queeny's](https://www.queenysdurham.com/), a DjangoCon US institution. No one ever seems to turn down dinner at Queeny's. :)

### Connections Made

I chatted with Thibaud Colas about his sustainability talk and got some tips from him. 

I listened in on a conversation with Lee Trout and Adam Fast and learned about some new tools. 

I pointed out Chris May's HTMX talk to Philip, a UI developer. He didn't know about HTMX and found it very enlightening. 

I chatted with Jay Miller about how DEFNA could better serve Black Python Devs and reported feedback. 

I found out from Frank Wiles that there is some early talk about a possible Lawrence Django event. 

I chatted with Simon Willison about some of my work duties, and he identified them as senior level. He told me about his excitement for his upcoming trip to see the [V & E Simonetti Historic Tuba Collection](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/v-e-simonetti-historic-tuba-collection).

I spent some much needed quality time with Lacey Henschel. She told me that I can learn anything. :) 

I met Django Fellow Sarah Boyce for the first time. We chatted about her work and DjangoCon Europe. In addition to her DjangoCon US talk, Sarah recently gave an excellent talk [Django Core Demystified](https://youtu.be/8rIylYYCmSI?si=8RsuP6VX41mVS0p6). 

I connected Thibaud with myself, Nicole, and Peter to talk about DjangoCon US website improvements and using it for other conference sites.

### Visa Frustration

As our conference becomes more diverse, a common frustration has emerged: difficulty getting a visa to enter the US. People from multiple countries have voiced their frustration about this to me. Django community member Julius Boakye poured his heart into a must-read post about it: [Breaking Barriers: A Tech Speaker‚Äôs Plea for Fair Visa Policies](https://medium.com/@theflyboy/breaking-barriers-a-tech-speakers-plea-for-fair-visa-policies-621b5909e496).

I was racking my brain to figure out what to eat for lunch. I joined a group and walked the short distance to [Pie Pushers](https://www.piepushers.com/). 

A slice of Italian sausage and a simple house salad really hit the spot! It was the best tasting pizza I've had in quite a while.

### Sarah P. Duke Gardens

For months, I had been looking forward to making it back to the [Sarah P. Duke Gardens](https://gardens.duke.edu/). It is "the Cadillac" of botanical gardens with jaw dropping scenes everywhere. It's also said to be a different garden with every new season or even new month. I'd visit Durham again just to go back.

### Cocoa Cinnamon

I love [Cocoa Cinnamon](https://littlewaves.coffee/pages/old-north-durham) coffee shop. I first tried it last year and went back several times during DjangoCon US 2024. I don't just love it for the coffee, which is amazing, by the way. On my first visit this year, I was offered a free Chai Latte. As I sat drinking it, they offered a free coffee that was redeemed by a student sitting studying. According to their menu, they also offer reduced price coffees as a service to the community. It's nice to patronize a business that shows kindness. 

Drinks had:
* Chai Latte: "Housemade chai blend of cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, rose, anise, & black pepper served unsweetened or with honey or vanilla syrup"
* Caramelo: "Sweet & creamy latte with with dulce de leche named for Sandra Cisneros' novel" 
* Al Mohka: "Latte with 70% single origin housemade chocolate sauce & cinnamon. Reference to first ever coffee port"

### The Can Opener

I acted on a tip from fellow DEFNA Board Member Drew Winstel and visited The Can Opener. 

Built in the 1940s when vehicles weren't as large, [The Can Opener](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/truck-decapitating-bridge), a railroad trestle bridge, was a mere 11 feet, 8 inches tall until 8 inches were added in 2019. Even with this improvement and warning signs well in advance, the bridge continues to peel the tops off trucks.

### 21c Museum Hotel

Last year, I didn't make it to the [21c Museum Hotel](https://www.21cmuseumhotels.com/) to see the hotel's signature artwork, so I thought it would be a fun experience this year. I was particularly taken by the see-into bathrooms. Also, the bank vault was a fun throwback to the hotel's past as a bank.

### The Durham Hotel

I went to [The Durham Hotel](https://www.thedurham.com/roof/), because I heard it has the best public view of the Durham skyline in town. I later had a much higher view of the skyline from the private 28th floor of One City Center, but The Durham Hotel architecture and interior design were well worth a visit in their own right.

### Mother and Sons

I'd been hungry for good Italian food for a while. [Mother and Sons](https://www.mothersandsonsnc.com/) had very high ratings, so I decided to give it a try. 

I'd planned to play it safe and order the potato gnocchi. I asked the waiter if there was a particular dish that was very popular. He said the squid ink tonnarelli. I told him I'd always wondered what squid ink pasta tasted like, but had been afraid to order it. He said that the squid ink taste was mild. So, I ordered it, and it delicious. It had a lemon-butter shrimp taste.

### Durham Food Hall

I'd already eaten, but joined a few attendees to walk over to the [Durham Food Hall](https://durhamfoodhall.com/) so they could eat. It was a thriving place with a lot of great options.

### Press Coffee, Crepes, and Cocktails

I love [Press Coffee, Crepes, and Cocktails](https://pressccc.com/). It's a short walk south of the downtown and well worth it. It's a coffeehouse specializing in savory and sweet crepes. The space has a bright, energectic vibe and the food and coffee are very high quality.   

First time eating avocado toast... I went big! This was gourmet quality, for sure. The seasonal salted pistachio mocha latte was to die for.

### Centerfest

Serendipitiously, an art festival called [Centerfest](https://durhamarts.org/centerfest/) was taking place on Saturday and Sunday. 

I wandered through the art booths, then stumbled upon one of many musical acts. It was called Heart of Carolina A Capella. It was fun!

### Durham Market Culture

It's wonderful to see Durham's thriving market and festival culture. In addition to Centerfest, I stumbled upon the [Durham Farmers' Market](https://www.durhamfarmersmarket.com/), [Durham Craft Market](https://durhamcentralpark.org/events/durham-craft-market/), and [Durham Underground Market](https://makrs.com/durham-underground-market) all in the same weekend. 

On Sunday, I was looking for a quick, tasty lunch and decided to try the fare of a [Durham Underground Market](https://makrs.com/durham-underground-market) food truck. 

[Cousins Maine Lobster](https://www.cousinsmainelobster.com/) piqued my interest. According to the truck, the founders had appeared on Shark Tank. 

I ordered a lobster tail, but they were out, so they upgraded me to a lobster roll and tots. It was my first time eating a lobster roll. It was tasty! 

This was the moment when I realized my low cholesterol diet was officially suspended

### The Parlour

I made a trip to [The Parlour](https://theparlour.co/) for the second year in a row. Last year, I had chocolate and was underwhelmed. This year, I had their most popular flavor- Salted Butter Caramel. It was truly incredible. I hope to make it back to Durham someday and visit The Parlour again!
