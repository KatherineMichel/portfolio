Me and Deb Nicholson, new PSF Executive Director... I met Deb unexpectedly at the pre-conference Django Social. It was a pleasure to get the chance to hang out with her throughout the week! I hope to do it again soon.

## DjangoCon US 2022

One night while I was having dinner with favorite author Eric Matthes and now DEFNA Board Member Tim Schilling, former DEFNA Board Member Craig Bruce showed up unexpectedly. What a wonderful surprise! During all of the time that we'd been fellow board members, we'd never actually met in person. As usual, I'd been to the beach earlier in the week and gotten a bit too much sun. :)

At the end of a conference day, I was hanging out in the lobby among other stragglers and was invited to dinner by my friends Vicky and Jonan. Guido happened to be in attendance. What a magical evening!

## GitHub Universe 2019

![](favorite-conference-photos/github-universe-2019-github-hq-tour.JPG)
At PyGotham 2019, within just a few hours of time, attendees invited me to tour Twitter, GitHub, and Salesforce Tower. During GitHub Universe 2019, I toured Twitter and GitHub. Unfortunately, my friend who worked at Salesforce was ill, so I didn't tour the tower. Here I am at GitHub in front of the iconic Octocat statue.

## Strange Loop 2019

![](favorite-conference-photos/strange-loop-2019-me-with-marcia.JPG)
My longtime Twitter friend Marcia Dorsey was volunteering at an event outside the Strange Loop venue. I couldn't pass up an opportunity to take a break from the conference and meet her in person. I told her how fun it had been to meet Jack at a tweet up the year before! I tried to get her to set me up on a date with him, but it didn't happen, lol.

After the conference, I flew to San Francisco. I visited my friend Betty Junod at Docker Headquarters. Fun! 

![](favorite-conference-photos/djangocon-us-2018-meeting-jack-at-a-tweet-up.jpg)
Before I went to Docker, Jack Dorsey tweeted that there would be a tweet up in San Francisco later in the day. When I left Docker, I went to the tweet up. I met Jack, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, and a bunch of other Twitter, Inc principals, including then CFO Ned Segal, Head of Product Kayvon Beykpour, early investor Bijan Sabet, and Recode journalist Kurt Wagner. Amazing night! Jack was shockingly nice. When I walked up to the gaggle around him, he asked me my name. Later, I took a pic with him. 

## PyGotham 2018

Incredibly, the day before the conference started, I was walking around mid-town Manhattan alone and saw my friend Tim! What are the odds? He invited me to dinner at one of his favorite restaurants. Here I am with Trey, Tim, Kenneth (DjangoCon US 2018 Co-Chair), and Lindsey. A treasured memory.
