# Favorite Conference Snapshots

Although these snapshots do not include all of the people who are special to me, they give a taste of the fun and serendipity of my conference travels over the years. In the Python community, as they say, the world is your oyster. A huge thank you to everyone who has made these incredible experiences possible over the years. 

## PyTexas 2024

![](favorite-conference-photos/pytexas-2024-jason-koo.jpg)
I met Jason Koo at DjangoCon US 2022 in San Diego where he generously helped as an organizer. It was great to see him again, and I look forward to learning more about Neo4j Graph Database! On the bright, sunny, second day of PyTexas, he invited me to be in this photo. It was a pleasure to get a snapshot next to my incredible friend Carol Willing. She had given an amazing keynote that morning. It is a must watch! I was also standing next to Josh Cannon who read the very clever Oh the (Methods) You Can (Make) book by Dunder Seuss. 

## DjangoCon US 2024

![](favorite-conference-photos/djangocon-us-2024-lemur-1.jpg)
As a DEFNA Board Member, I help oversee DjangoCon US, including the website design. Because our host city Durham, North Carolina has the largest population of lemurs outside of Madagascar, we featured a "friendly" lemur on our website last year. After years of hearing about Tanganyika Wildlife Park in Goddard, Kansas, mom and I decided to go today. I had no idea until I got there that you can feed lemurs. They were so soft and gentle. I loved spending time with these real-life, friendly lemurs!

Me and Deb Nicholson, new PSF Executive Director... I met Deb unexpectedly at the pre-conference Django Social. It was a pleasure to get the chance to hang out with her throughout the week! I hope to do it again soon.

## DjangoCon US 2022

October 16-21, San Diego, California

![](favorite-conference-photos/djangocon-us-2022-me-and-craig-bruce.jpg)
One night while I was having dinner with favorite author Eric Matthes and now DEFNA Board Member Tim Schilling, former DEFNA Board Member Craig Bruce showed up unexpectedly. What a wonderful surprise! During all of the time that we'd been fellow board members, we'd never actually met in person. As usual, I'd been to the beach earlier in the week and gotten a bit too much sun. :)

## DjangoCon US 2021

October 21-23, online

![](favorite-conference-photos/djangocon-us-2021-get-a-jumpstart-english.png)
Following in the footsteps of PyCon US and with multiple Spanish-speakers on our DEFNA Board, we decided to have a Charlas track. Giving a talk in Spanish had been on my bucket list for quite some time. I decided to submit a proposal and it was accepted. I ended up recording the talk in both Spanish and English, and they were both played simultaneously. My pre-recorded talk Get a Jumpstart on Collaboration and Code Review in GitHub playing in English.

## PyCascades 2020

February 8-9, Portland, Oregon

![](favorite-conference-photos/pycascades-2020-dinner-with-guido.jpg)
At the end of a conference day, I was hanging out in the lobby among other stragglers and was invited to dinner by my friends Vicky Tuite and Jonan Scheffler. Python creator and BDFL Guido van Rossum happened to be in attendance. What a magical evening!

## GitHub Universe 2019

November 13-14, San Francisco, California

![](favorite-conference-photos/github-universe-2019-nat.JPG)
After Nat Friedman, then GitHub CEO, tweeted to me that he'd love meet, I had the chance to talk to him briefly. It was super fun to hear from him in person. Love open source! 

![](favorite-conference-photos/github-universe-2019-github-hq-tour.JPG)
At PyGotham 2019, within just a few hours of time, attendee Jigyasa Grover invited me to tour Twitter, Froi Irizarry Rivera invited me to tour GitHub, and Casey Faist invited me to Salesforce Tower. During GitHub Universe 2019, I toured Twitter and GitHub. Unfortunately, Casey was ill, so I didn't tour the tower. Here I am at GitHub in front of the iconic Octocat statue.

## Strange Loop 2019

September 13-14, Saint Louis, Missouri

![](favorite-conference-photos/strange-loop-2019-me-with-marcia.JPG)
My longtime Twitter friend Marcia Dorsey was volunteering at an event outside the Strange Loop venue. I couldn't pass up an opportunity to take a break from the conference and meet her in person. I told her how fun it had been to meet her son Twitter and Square co-founder Jack Dorsey at a tweet up the year before! I tried to get her to set me up on a date with him, but it didn't happen, lol.

After the conference, I flew to San Francisco. I visited my friend Betty Junod at Docker Headquarters. Fun! 

![](favorite-conference-photos/djangocon-us-2018-meeting-jack-at-a-tweet-up.jpg)
Before I went to Docker, Jack Dorsey tweeted that there would be a tweet up in San Francisco later in the day. When I left Docker, I went to the tweet up at Tacolicious. I met Jack, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, and a bunch of other Twitter, Inc principals, including then CFO Ned Segal, Head of Product Kayvon Beykpour, early investor Bijan Sabet, and Recode journalist Kurt Wagner. Amazing night! When I walked up to the gaggle around Jack, he was shockingly nice. Later, I took a pic with him. 

## PyGotham 2018

October 5-6, New York, New York

![](favorite-conference-photos/pygotham-2018-han-dynasty.jpg)
Incredibly, the day before the conference started, I was walking around mid-town Manhattan alone and saw my friend Tim! What are the odds? He invited me to dinner at one of his favorite restaurants. Here I am with Trey Hunner, Tim Allen, Kenneth Love (DjangoCon US 2018 Co-Chair), and Lindsey Dragun. A treasured memory.

## DjangoCon US 2017

August 13-18, Spokane, Washington

![](favorite-conference-photos/djangocon-us-2017-on-stage.jpg)
Me giving my talk Get a Jumpstart on Collaboration and Code Review in GitHub. I gave my first conference talk at the first conference that I ever attended. I practiced using the AV system at a local church. I realized later that I had a lot of room for improvement (the speaker ahead of me was a veteran public speaker and technologist and watching her made me see how well it could be done), but it was a start. DjangoCon US loves to be the place where people get their start giving talks. :) Photo credit: Adam Gregory (https://atomimages509.wixsite.com/atom)
