# Los Angeles 2023

## Wednesday

I finished my work year with a successful presentation to my department, then a few hours later, arrived at LAX for a nine day vacation. It was the first non-business trip that I'd taken in years. I had a general idea of the things I wanted to do, but hadn't done much planning. I played it by ear, and it worked. 

### Santa Monica Pier at Night

Perhaps because I have spent most of my life in a landlocked state, when I arrive in a city on the coast, I am dying to get to the ocean. 

### North Italia

I was looking for a convenient, but decent place to eat dinner. I stumbled upon North Italia while walking down the street. The food is handmade with the best ingredients, and it was good, but a bit high falutin' Italian for my taste. Later in the week, I discovered another Italian restaurant nearby called Bruno's Ristorante Italiano. North Italia did not compare to the simple, delicious authenticity of Bruno's. Bruno's perfectly hit the spot for me. Sorry, North Italia.

## Thursday

### Blue Daisy

On Thursday, I ate breakfast at [Blue Daisy](https://www.bluedaisycafe.com/brunch-santa-monica/). I picked it on the spur of the moment, because it was nearby and the reviews I read were positive. The staff were wonderful, but the food was underwhelming.

I had 3 eggs scrambled with mushroom, which came with zucchini hash and a plain crepe with jam. 

I asked the waiter if the zucchini hash came from another culture. He laughed and said it's something the chef invented to make breakfast healthier. Sounds like an LA thing. I don't know if I want my breakfast to be that healthy. 

The best part of the meal was a delicious Turkish Latte ("creamy and a touch of sweetness").

### Warner Brothers Studio Tour versus Universal Studios Tour

The Warner Brothers tour guides immediately established their tour as "better" than Universal's. Although it was lighthearted banter, I did detect a hint of competition. 

#### What Warner Brothers Had Going For It

The Warner Brothers tour was a personalized, small group experience. At the start of the tour, the tour guide asked us which Warner Brothers shows or movies we were fans of so that the tour could be tailored to our interests. During the guided part of the tour, we were all on one cart in close proximity to the tour guide and could ask questions as we went. We get off several times to tour city lots, a sound stage, and house. 

There were multiple photo ops, including the Friends set, Big Bang Theory set, and Friends fountain. 

Before and after the guided part of the tour, we had the opportunity to walk at our own pace through exhibits packed with costumes, props, special effects, and info. 

I spent 3 hours on the Warner Brothers tour. 

#### What Universal Studios Tour Had Going For It

In contrast, the Universal Studios tour consisted of one large group riding on a group of connected carts with a pre-recorded commentary by Jimmy Fallon. Although tour guides had the freedom to provide their own additional commentary, group members did not have the opportunity to ask questions or get off the cart to take a closer look. 

However, the Universal Studios tour did include some very iconic backlots, and nothing at Warner Brothers compared to Universal's interactive, 3-D experiences. 

I spent approximately 45 minutes on the Universal Studio Tour.  

### Warner Brothers Studio Tour

After some quick research, I settled on Warner Brothers Studio Tour as a top priority. It was an incredible, in-depth experience. 

Because I hadn't read up on the details of the Warner Brothers tour ahead of time, I didn't know about the focus on Friends. 

The chance to take a photo on the real Friends set was a super fun surprise and gave me a feeling of child-like delight. What a great way to kick of off my sightseeing.

### Dolby Theater Tour

After the Warner Brothers Studio Tour, I traveled over to Hollywood for the Dolby Theater Tour. I really enjoyed this tour. It was one of the most fun things that I've ever done. 

My tour guide was a long-time Academy Awards ceremony crew member. We walked in the footsteps of the A-List stars into the theater, then backstage and on stage where we had a view of the audience from where the presenters stand. We exited stage left, then took the red carpet Winner's Walk that only Academy Award winners and tour participants get to take. All the while, our tour guide gave some inside stories from her years of working at the ceremony.

### Universal Theme Park

Although I wanted to take the Universal Studio Tour, I was irked that I would have to buy an entire Universal Theme Park ticket to take it. Later in the trip, a Lyft driver convinced me to do it. She said, it's the best, because you are "in the movies."

### Via Alloro

While I was on the celebrity home bus tour, we drove around Beverly Hills. As we drove past this restaurant off of Rodeo Drive, the bus driver said it's a major celebrity hotspot and that he'd seen Steven Spielberg here, among others. Someone on the bus asked if you had to be dressed up to go in. The bus driver said no, and that he'd had bus riders literally call while on the bus and make a reservation. After the tour ended, I went back to Rodeo Drive for pics and decided to stop to eat there. The prices were surprisingly reasonable and the food was delicious. It felt like a surprisingly normal experience. The waiter told me that they do have "too many" celebs around. Sometimes, everywhere you look. A quick google search does reveal some of the many celebs. https://www.viaalloro.com/

### The Ice 

If I hadn't already done enough... I went ice skating for the first time! 

It was fun, and I skated for a good 30 minutes, but when another skater wiped out badly, I decided that I'd pushed my luck long enough and stopped. The rink workers said the skates weren't great anyway, because they provided very little support. Nevertheless, I'm glad I tried it, and perhaps I'll try again sometime.

### Mel's Drive-In

I saw a Mel's Drive-in at Universal Studios Theme Park and another one just off Hollywood Boulevard. Because I kept hearing about it so much, I decided to eat at one in Santa Monica. I later realized that I had Mel's Drive-in mixed up with Mel's Diner. Mel's Drive-in was made famous by the movie American Graffiti. Mel's Drive-in was a television show. Haha. Nevertheless, the chocolate milkshake was the best that I've ever had.

## What I Learned

Although I considered taking the Paramount Studio Tour, it was one too many studio tours for this trip.
