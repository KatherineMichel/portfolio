## Wednesday

I finished my work year with a successful presentation to my department, then a few hours later, arrived at LAX for a nine day vacation. It was the first non-business trip that I'd taken in years. I had a general idea of the things I wanted to do, but hadn't done much planning. I played it by ear, and it worked. 

### Santa Monica Pier at Night

### North Italia

I was looking for a convenient, but decent place to eat dinner. I stumbled upon North Italia while walking down the street. The food is handmade with the best ingredients, and it was good, but a bit high falutin' Italian for my taste. Later in the week, I discovered another Italian restaurant nearby called Bruno's Ristorante Italiano. North Italia did not compare to the simple, delicious authenticity of Bruno's. Bruno's perfectly hit the spot for me. Sorry, North Italia.

## Thursday

### Blue Daisy

On Thursday, I ate breakfast at [Blue Daisy](https://www.bluedaisycafe.com/brunch-santa-monica/). I picked it on the spur of the moment, because it was nearby and the reviews I read were positive. The staff were wonderful, but the food was underwhelming.

I had 3 eggs scrambled with mushroom, which came with zucchini hash and a plain crepe with jam. 

I asked the waiter if the zucchini hash came from another culture. He laughed and said it's something the chef invented to make breakfast healthier. Sounds like an Los Angeles thing. I don't know if I want my breakfast to be that healthy. 

The best part of the meal was a delicious Turkish Latte ("creamy and a touch of sweetness"). 

### Santa Monica and Venice Beaches

Perhaps because I have spent most of my life in a landlocked state, when I arrive in a city on the coast, I can't wait to get to the ocean. 

On my first full day in Los Angeles, I walked from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach Pier via the boardwalk, then back to Santa Monica Pier via the ocean. 

The San Diego beaches that I've been to have been more breathtaking (south of La Jolla Cove) and more Califiornia-y (Pacific and Ocean Beaches Boardwalks), but it was great to be near the ocean again. 

## Friday

### Warner Brothers Studio Tour

<!--
See my note at the end for a comparison between Warner Brothers Studio Tour and Universal Studio Tour

Highlights
-->

After some quick research, I settled on [Warner Brothers Studio Tour](https://www.wbstudiotour.com/tour/studio/) as a top priority. It was an incredible, in-depth experience. 

Because I hadn't read up on the details of the Warner Brothers tour ahead of time, I had no idea what I would see. 

The chance to take a photo on the real Friends set was a super fun surprise and gave me a feeling of childlike delight. What a great way to kick of off my Hollywood sightseeing.

### Dolby Theater Tour

After the Warner Brothers Studio Tour, I traveled over to Hollywood for the [Dolby Theater Tour](https://dolbytheatre.com/tours/tour-information/). The Dolby Theater is the location of the Academy Awards Ceremony. I really enjoyed this tour. It was one of the most fun things that I've ever done. 

My tour guide was a long-time Academy Awards Ceremony crew member. We walked in the footsteps of the A-list stars into the theater, then backstage and on stage where we had a view of the audience from where the presenters stand. We exited stage left, then took the red carpet Winner's Walk that only Academy Award winners and tour participants get to take. All the while, our tour guide gave some inside stories from her years of working at the ceremony.

On Oscar night, Hollywood Boulevard becomes a walkway for the stars. Normally the entrance to the [Ovation Shopping Center](https://www.ovationhollywood.com/), attendees will walk down this grand, elaborately decorated hall.

## Saturday

### République

I started Saturday by eating breakfast at a bakery/café called République in a building that Charlie Chaplin had built. République is owned by two chefs awarded a Michelin Star and a James Beards award and one of whom worked with Alain Ducasse of the Dorchester Collection, my old stomping grounds. A foodie colleague and friend Wooyong Ee recommended it. It was excellent. 

Much of the building's original architecture is intact, as seen in these [photos](https://martinturnbull.com/2020/06/02/charlie-chaplins-italian-villa-inspired-building-at-624-s-la-brea-ave-los-angeles-circa-late-1920s/). The restaurant floor appears to be in what was an open courtyard, with the arches still in existence. Imagine walking the same grounds as Charlie Chaplin. Mind blowing.

## Sunday

### The Getty Center

The Getty Center experience was well worth the trip. The architecture, art, and views were all simply jaw dropping.

[Central Garden](https://www.getty.edu/visit/center/top-things-to-do/gardens/): a garden with an incredible view. I almost overlooked it. Fortunately, I came back a second time and ventured to the other side of the garden.

Example of the beautiful architecture... beautiful fountain!

Although I enjoyed the view of Los Angeles from the main Getty Center terrace, the consensus from locals was that the view from the The Griffith Observatory is much better.

## Monday

### République

On my way to the Grammy Museum, I stopped at République again for breakfast. I regretted that I hadn't ordered Shrimp and Grits (anson mills grits, calabrian chilies, pork belly sausage, hooks cheddar, fried egg) on Saturday, then realized that dish is only served at weekend brunch and wasn't available on a Monday. I will have to go back sometime and try it. I did have some absolutely incredible tasting granola. It was beautifully presented, and although some of the fruit was unfamiliar to me, it was bursting with delicious flavor, and definitely in the running for the most delicious breakfast that I have ever eaten.

Granola: straus organic yogurt, farmer’s market fruit, wildflower honey

### The Grammy Museum

The Grammy Museum was surpringly small for an awards ceremony as important as it is, but it did have an impressive collection of Michael Jackson memorabilia, including the Thriller Jacket. Two whole floors, plus a portion of another had temporary exhibits that weren't particularly of interest to me (Shakira, The Roxy, and Hip-Hop America). There was not much to see beyond that.

### The Cecil Hotel

<!--
https://allthatsinteresting.com/cecil-hotel-los-angeles
-->

I have been fascinated by true crime going back to childhood, when I started watching [48 Hours](https://www.cbsnews.com/48-hours/full-episodes/), my all-time favorite show. 

While I was walking from the Grammy Museum to the to City Hall Observatory Deck, I stopped at Hotel Cecil along the way. 

Hotel Cecil (a.k.a "Hotel Death") was the subject of a Netflix documentary called [Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel](https://www.netflix.com/title/81183727). The documentary focused on the case of [Elisa Lam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deaths_and_violence_at_the_Cecil_Hotel), a Canadian student suffering from bi-polar disease who drowned in a water tank on the roof. Members of the public crowd-sourced an investigation into what happened to Elisa. The hotel has a long history of murder, suicide, and unexplained deaths. In a strange twist, Richard Ramirez, a serial killer profiled in another Netflix documentary Night Stalker, stayed at Hotel Cecil. 

![](los-angeles-2023-images/hotel-cecil-1.jpg)
The hotel is shuttered with a "private property" sign on one door. There were a few people nearby. Not sure if they were workers or loitering.

![](los-angeles-2023-images/hotel-cecil-2.jpg)
The infamous water tanks where Elisa Lam drowned... it was speculated that she might have taken the stairs on the front of the hotel to the roof.

### Downtown Los Angeles

While I was walking from the Grammy Museum to the to City Hall Observatory Deck, I walked a few blocks into [Skid Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_Row,_Los_Angeles). Having heard of Skid Row for years, I wanted to see it for myself. I walked by barbed wire, sidewalk tent encampments, many homeless, and a mission providing social services. 

Strangely, Skid Row is next to the Toy and Fashion Districts. I can't get over the extreme opulence and poverty existing side by side across Los Angeles. 

![](los-angeles-2023-images/downtown-la-skid-row.jpg)
The homelessness in Los Angeles was a sad reality. A local told me it increased greatly due to the pandemic.

### Bruno's Ristorante Italiano

After a few failed Google searches for restaurants in the area, I stumbled upon the absolute gem [Bruno's Ristorante Italiano](https://brunossantamonica.com/)

![](los-angeles-2023-images/brunos-night-1.jpg)
Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken... the best that I've ever had. So good!

### Universal Theme Park

-->

Although I wanted to take the [Universal Studio Tour](https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-and-attractions/the-world-famous-studio-tour), I was irked that I would have to buy an entire [Universal Theme Park](https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us) ticket to take it. After multiple told me how fun the theme park including a Lyft driver who said it's the best, because you are "in the movies," I decided to go. I know what she means now that I've experienced the incredible, immersive, 3-D experiences. Anyhow, it's not everyday that you have the chance to visit a theme park like that. 

I guess I got my money's worth for the studio tour alone. I went twice... riding on either side of the cart to get a good look at everything. 

Having been an [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock) fan since I was a kid (I had probably read every [Alfred Hitchcock Presents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents) book at the Fredonia Public Library while I was still in grade school), I really enjoyed seeing the Bates Motel and mother's house from [Psycho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)).

I walked most of the park. It was fun, but geared more toward kids.

### The Griffith Observatory

Although The Griffith Observatory museum was much smaller than I expected, the building was beautiful and had an amazing view. 

Multiple Lyft drivers told me the view is "spectacular" after dark, but frankly, I was too tired to stay that long. I will go back sometime. 

### Comedy in English

That night, I attended a comedy show for the first time. It was called [Comedy in English](https://www.facebook.com/Comineng/) and features comedians who have appeared on The Tonight Show, Conan, Comedy Central, and Netflix. 

There were awkward, confrontational jokes, excruciating silences, and big laughs. What a raw exercise!

![](los-angeles-2023-images/comedy-show.jpg)
The comedian before him was scream-y... this one was quiet and thoughtful. I thought he'd bomb, but he didn't! 

## Wednesday

### Celebrity Homes Bus Tour

I went on a celebrity homes bus tour, and it was an absolute blast. I’ve never taken a bus tour like it before. I loved every minute. The tour guide Mark was so fun and knew all of the famous spots. We drove all around the Hollywood Hills and Bel Air looking at celebrity homes, through Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, West Hollywood, Sunset Strip, and Hollywood. Although I couldn't verify the authenticity of every home afterward, I believe that Mark knew his stuff.

### Via Alloro

While I was on the celebrity home bus tour, we drove around Beverly Hills. As we drove past a restauraunt named [Via Alloro](https://www.viaalloro.com/) just off of Rodeo Drive, the bus driver said it's a major celebrity hotspot and that he'd seen Steven Spielberg there, among others. Someone on the bus asked if you had to be dressed up to go in. The bus driver said no, and that he'd had bus riders literally call while on the bus and make a reservation. 

After the tour ended, I went back to Rodeo Drive and walked down the entire street taking pics. Afteward, I decided to eat at Via Alloro. I knew if I didn't, I'd regret that I hadn't taken the opportunity to rub shoulders with the stars. 

The prices were surprisingly reasonable and the food was delicious. It felt like a surprisingly normal experience. The waiter told me that they do have "too many" celebs around. Sometimes, everywhere you look. A quick [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=via+alloro+daily+mail&sca_esv=595179528&sxsrf=AM9HkKl7xam2HHlNbSzt-XLzlojjw9_Jug:1704229408712&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvmpakzb-DAxWpkmoFHQsSDt0Q0pQJegQIBhAC&biw=1440&bih=699&dpr=2#ip=1) reveals some of the many celebs. 

I had the Fettuccini Boscaiola. Having never heard of this dish, I wasn't quite sure what it would be like, but I thought it sounded good. It was delicious!

## Thursday

### Ice at Santa Monica 

If I hadn't already done enough... I went ice skating for the first time! 

I went to [Ice at Santa Monica](https://iceatsantamonica.com/). 

It was fun, and I skated for a good 30 minutes, but when another skater wiped out badly, I decided that I'd pushed my luck long enough and stopped. The rink workers said the skates weren't great anyway, because they provided very little support. Nevertheless, I'm glad I tried it, and perhaps I'll try again sometime.

### Mel's Drive-In

I saw a [Mel's Drive-in](https://melsdrive-in.com/) at Universal Studios Theme Park and another one just off Hollywood Boulevard. Because I kept hearing about it so much, I decided to eat at one in Santa Monica. I later realized that I had Mel's Drive-in mixed up with Mel's Diner. Mel's Drive-in was made famous by the movie [American Graffiti](https://melsdrive-in.com/about/#story). [Mel's Diner](https://www.alicehyatt.com/) was a television show. Haha. Nevertheless, the chocolate milkshake was the best that I've ever had.

## What I Learned

![](los-angeles-2023-images/my-feeling-about-la.png)
My feeling about Los Angeles...

I love San Diego's Little Italy. It's a thriving area of the city centered around a Plaza with a fountain, music, open air dining, and great restaurants surrounding it. I thought Santa Monica would be like this, but it wasn't. I was surprised by the isolated, distributed nature of Los Angeles. 

My takeaway from the entertainment indusry was that it's more ordinary than I expected. Just like the desire among many Los Angeles to appear to be living among their means...

Things to do next time:
* Although I considered taking the Paramount Studio Tour, it was one too many studio tours for this trip.
* Go to The Griffith Observatory at night

## Warner Brothers Studio Tour versus Universal Studios Tour

The Warner Brothers tour guides immediately established their tour as "better" than Universal's. Although it was lighthearted banter, I did detect a real hint of competition. 

### What Warner Brothers Had Going For It

The Warner Brothers tour was a personalized, small group experience. At the start of the tour, the tour guide asked us which Warner Brothers shows or movies we were fans of so that the tour could be tailored to our interests. During the guided part of the tour, we were all on one cart in close proximity to the tour guide and could ask questions as we went. We get off several times to tour city lots, a sound stage, residential street, and house. 

There were multiple photo ops, including the Friends set, Big Bang Theory set, and Friends fountain. 

Before and after the guided part of the tour, we had the opportunity to walk at our own pace through exhibits packed with incredible costumes, props, and immersive experiences. 

I spent 3 hours on the Warner Brothers tour. 

### What Universal Studios Tour Had Going For It

In contrast, the Universal Studios tour consisted of one large group riding on a group of connected carts with a pre-recorded commentary by Jimmy Fallon. Although tour guides had the freedom to provide their own additional commentary, group members did not have the opportunity to ask questions or get off the cart to take a closer look. 

However, the Universal Studios tour did include some very iconic backlots, and nothing at Warner Brothers compared to Universal's immersive, 3-D experiences. 

I spent approximately 45 minutes on the Universal Studio Tour.
