# Los Angeles 2023

## Wednesday

I finished my work year with a successful presentation to my department, then a few hours later, arrived at LAX for a nine day vacation. It was the first non-business trip that I'd taken in years. I had a general idea of the things I wanted to do, but hadn't done much planning. I played it by ear, and it worked. 

### Santa Monica Pier at Night

Perhaps because I have spent most of my life in a landlocked state, when I arrive in a city on the coast, I am dying to get to the ocean. 

### North Italia

I was looking for a convenient, but decent place to eat dinner. I stumbled upon North Italia while walking down the street. The food is handmade with the best ingredients, and it was good, but a bit high falutin' for me. Later in the week, I discovered another Italian restaurant nearby called Bruno's Ristorante Italiano. North Italia did not compare to the simple, delicious authenticity of Bruno's. Bruno's perfectly hit the spot for me. Sorry, North Italia.

## Thursday

### Blue Daisy

On Thursday, I ate breakfast at [Blue Daisy](https://www.bluedaisycafe.com/brunch-santa-monica/). I picked it on the spur of the moment, because it was nearby and the reviews I read were positive. The staff were wonderful, but the food was underwhelming.

I had 3 eggs scrambled with mushroom, which came with zucchini hash and a plain crepe with jam. 

I asked the waiter if the zucchini hash came from another culture. He laughed and said it's something the chef invented to make breakfast healthier. Sounds like an LA thing. I don't know if I want my breakfast to be that healthy. 

The best part of the meal was a delicious Turkish Latte ("creamy and a touch of sweetness"). 

### Santa Monica and Venice Beaches

### Trader Joe's

## Friday

### Warner Brothers Studio Tour

After some quick research, I settled on Warner Brothers Studio Tour as a top priority. It was an incredible experience. 

The Warner Brothers tour guides immediately established their tour as "better" than Universal's. For one thing, it was a personalized, small group experience. At the start of the tour, the tour guide asked us which Warner Brothers shows or movies we were fans of so that the tour could be tailored to our interests. During the guided part of the tour, we were all on one cart in close proximity to the tour guide and could ask questions as we went. 

In contrast, the Univeral Studios tour consisted of one large group riding on a group of connected carts with a pre-recorded commentary by Jimmy Fallon. Although tour guides had the freedom to provide their own commentary, group members did not have the opportunity to ask questions or see things unique to their own interests. 

However, the Universal Studios tour did include some iconic backlots, and nothing at Warner Brothers compared to Universal's interactive, 3-D experiences. 

I spent 3 hours on the Warner Brothers tour, compared to around 45 minutes on the Universal Studio Tour.  

I hadn't read up on the details of the Warner Brothers tour ahead of time. 

The chance to take a photo on the real Friends set was an unexpectedly fun surprise.

### Dolby Theater Tour

After the Warner Brothers Studio Tour, I traveled over to Hollywood for the Dolby Theater Tour. I really enjoyed this tour. It was one of the most fun things that I've ever done. 

With an Academy Awards Ceremony staff member as your tour guide, you walk in the steps of the A-List stars into the theater, backstage, onto the stage where the presenter stands with a view of the audience, stage left, and down the red carpet Winner's Walk that only Academy Award winners and tour participants get to take.

### Universal Theme Park

Although I wanted to take the Universal Studio Tour, I was irked that I would have to buy an entire Universal Theme Park ticket to take it. Later in the trip, a Lyft driver convinced me to do it. She said, it's the best, because you are "in the movies."

## What I Learned

Although I considered taking the Paramount Studio Tour, it was one too many studio tours for this trip.
