<h1>Favorite Conference Snapshots<a class="headerlink" href="#favorite-conference-snapshots" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Although these snapshots do not include all of the people who are special to me, they give a taste of the fun and serendipity of my conference travels over the years. In the Python community, as they say, the world is your oyster. A huge thank you to everyone who has made these incredible experiences possible over the years.</p>

After the conference ended on Sunday night, I found myself chatting with a group of old friends and new friends. They invited me to dinner, and I decided to join. It was a wonderful time, as you can tell from the photo. :) Pictured: Tammy Do, Velda Kiara, Jim Anderson, Ngazetungue Muheue, Kudzayi Bamhare, Benedict Kofi Amofah, me, Afi Gbagado, and Catherine Devlin</p>

Not only does Ned Batchelder maintain a powerful Python package and give popular conference talks, he is also a juggling enthusiast. When I saw his juggling open space in progress, I couldn’t resist stopping. I juggled for the first time in probably decades!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/pycon-us-2024-me-by-melanie.jpg" />
My friend Melanie Arbor takes great profile pics. At DjangoCon US 2017, she took my pic, and I loved it. I’ve used it as my social media profile pic since then, but it’s getting a bit dated. I saw her at PyCon US and asked her if she would be willing to take a new profile pic of me. It turned out that she had already created a “Profile Pic Palooza” open space for Saturday at 3 pm. As a bonus, I got to catch up with Chalmer Lowe for the first time since PyCon 2019.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/pycon-us-2024-me-and-benedict.jpg" />
When I create this page of favorite conference snapshots, Benedict Kofi Amofah tweeted to me that he’d be in the gallery soon. I took him up on it. :)</p>

I met Jason Koo at DjangoCon US 2022 in San Diego where he generously helped as an organizer. It was great to see him again, and I look forward to learning more about Neo4j Graph Database! On the bright, sunny, second day of PyTexas, he invited me to be in this photo. It was a pleasure to get a snapshot next to my incredible friend Carol Willing. She had given an amazing keynote that morning. It is a must watch! I was also standing next to Josh Cannon who read the very clever Oh the (Methods) You Can (Make) book by Dunder Seuss.</p>

As a DEFNA Board Member, I help oversee DjangoCon US, including the website design. Because our host city Durham, North Carolina has the largest population of lemurs outside of Madagascar, we featured a “friendly” lemur on our website last year. After years of hearing about Tanganyika Wildlife Park in Goddard, Kansas, mom and I decided to go on April 6. I had no idea until I got there that you can feed lemurs. They were so soft and gentle. I loved spending time with these real-life, friendly lemurs!</p>

One night while I was having dinner with favorite author Eric Matthes and now DEFNA Board Member Tim Schilling, former DEFNA Board Member Craig Bruce showed up unexpectedly. What a wonderful surprise! During all of the time that we’d been fellow board members, we’d never actually met in person. As usual, I’d been to the beach earlier in the week and gotten a bit too much sun. :)</p>

Following in the footsteps of PyCon US and with multiple Spanish-speakers on our DEFNA Board, we decided to have a Charlas track. Giving a talk in Spanish had been on my bucket list for quite some time. I decided to submit a proposal and it was accepted. I ended up recording the talk in both Spanish and English, and they were both played simultaneously. My pre-recorded talk Get a Jumpstart on Collaboration and Code Review in GitHub playing in English.</p>

At PyGotham 2019, within just a few hours of time, attendee Jigyasa Grover invited me to tour Twitter, Froi Irizarry Rivera invited me to tour GitHub, and Casey Faist invited me to Salesforce Tower. During GitHub Universe 2019, I toured Twitter and GitHub. Unfortunately, Casey was ill, so I didn’t tour the tower. Here I am at GitHub in front of the iconic Octocat statue.</p>

My longtime Twitter friend Marcia Dorsey was volunteering at an event outside the Strange Loop venue. I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to take a break from the conference and meet her in person. I told her how fun it had been to meet her son Twitter and Square co-founder Jack Dorsey at a tweet up the year before!

Before I went to Docker, Jack Dorsey tweeted that there would be a tweet up in San Francisco later in the day. When I left Docker, I went to the tweet up at Tacolicious. I met Jack, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, and a bunch of other Twitter, Inc principals, including then CFO Ned Segal, Head of Product Kayvon Beykpour, early investor Bijan Sabet, and Recode journalist Kurt Wagner. Amazing night! When I walked up to the gaggle around Jack, he was shockingly nice. Later, I took a pic with him.</p>
