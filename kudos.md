In all these little ways, they sent a clear and cohesive message that emphasized the importance of making everyone feel welcome... Those details are where love and empathy live. Those details are fucks given. Those details made my hear warm, and made me feel at home. Thank you DjangoCon. It was an honor to get to know you."**<br>
