# 2023 Highlights

Rather than write a full blog post, this year, I decided to give some highlights of my year.

## New Certifications

Continuous learning is important to me. This year, I earned three new certifications. 

In May, I obtained an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. This certification has enabled me to better "speak" the common language of AWS. 

In July, I obtained CockroachDB Introduction to Distributed SQL and CockroachDB and Practical First Steps with CockroachDB certifications. I really enjoyed CockroachDB University. The lessons were succint, yet very well communicated how CockroachDB works and what sets it apart from Postgres. 

## PS Connect

My experience as a DEFNA Board Member and DjangoCon US Organizer came in handy when I obtained sponsorship from a JPMorgan Chase Managing Director to start a monthly departmental meetup in Plano that became known as PS Connect. I have had the opportunity to work with tech leads across teams to execute a highly successful launch and continue to grow it into a fun, sustainable, and value adding event. 

I was invited to give a DjangoCon US Recap presentation at our PS Connect Christmas Party December 6. It was a great opportunity to do some public speaking and get to know my department colleagues better.

## Diversity and Inclusion

During the second quarter, I completed a JPMorgan Chase [Women on the Move](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/people/women-on-the-move) (WoTM) Career Development Program. This outstanding program featured high impact modules on subjects such as fixed versus growth mindset, skill inventory, and negotiation. 

Throughout the year, I had the opportunity to attend a number of powerful, internal WoTM and Take It Forward (TIF) events. 

In June, I took part in the JPMorgan Chase Innovation Week Global Hackathon with a project in the DE&I category. We participated in the finals. Although we did not win, it was a great experience, and I made some new friends. 

## Django News Newsletter

Django News Newsletter is a fabulous newsletter published every Friday and filled with all of the most important Django news. I was honored to be included twice this year: for my  [DjangoCon US Talk Topics Inspiration List](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/portfolio/blob/master/conference-blog-posts/topic-ideas-djangocon-us-2023.md) and [DjangoCon US Recap](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/portfolio/blob/master/conference-blog-posts/recap-of-djangocon-us-2023.md). 

## Stanford Code in Place Article

In April, Stanford Engineering featured me an article "[Stanford Engineering offers free online introductory programming course](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/stanford-engineering-offers-free-online-introductory-programming-course)". I talked about my experience learning and teaching Python programming language as a Stanford Code in Place student in 2020 and section leader in 2021. It was an honor to be profiled. 

For more about my experience, check out my student recap "[Reflections on Stanford Code in Place](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/portfolio/blob/master/regular-blog-posts/reflections-on-stanford-code-in-place.md)" or my section leader [recap slides](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/stanford-code-in-place-section-leader). 

## Travel, Food, and Fun

Throughout the year, I enjoyed what Plano had to offer. Thank you to my Plano friends for some great times!

In December, I took the Los Angeles trip that I've been dreaming of taking for years. I'd had this trip planned twice before and cancelled, once due to wild fires, and once due to the pandemic. It was the last major US city on my bucket list. 



## Heavy Lifting

I led/co-led the completion of several substantial code features. I had the opportunity to lead team meetings such as Sprint Retro and Sprint Review and Demo. I gave code deep dives and demos to team members and managers. I mentored an apprentice. 

I was an onsite liason. 

Multi-tenancy and orchestration


## DEFNA

I served another year as a DEFNA Board Member. I challenged myself to do more "heavy lifting." I provided website CfP and design process oversight. I influenced the talk program, including an emphasis on DE&I. I recruited an outstanding new board member. 

I helped oversee the DjangoCon US website design by publishing our CfP, working to secure a web design contractor, and taking part in website design meetings. 

I created a talk topic inspiration list that was widely shared among leaders in the Django community, including in the Django News Newsletter, and undoubtedly contributed to the number of DjangoCon US proposals increasing from 158 the year before to 185. 

The list kickstarted a conversation that led to this talk by new Django Fellow Natalia Bidart: "Inside Out: My Journey of Understanding Inclusion." 

I went further in my understanding of our board level location/venue considerations, budget, and contract negotiations. 

## DjangoCon US

I attended DjangoCon US and made the most of the experience. Read my recap. 

In addition to being there as a DEFNA Board member, as an attendee, I made many new comments (including PSF Executive Director, Django Fellow), promoted diversity, and acquired new knowledge. 



## Quality and Standards

I did research into Python/Django standards and code quality tools. 

A co-worker and I co-presented about Advent of Code. 


I shared my open source experience. 

Best in class open source and inner source governance resources. 


## Tangential Learning

I attended multiple product meetups through Product Ignite and Women in Product. 

I took part in a five-part security challenge and finished around the top 10%. 

## Looking Ahead

I plan to attend PyTexas in April. 

A co-worker invited me to teach beginner/intermediate Django. I hope to finish the curriculum in early 2024 and teach multiple sessions throughout the year. 

Empower engineers to produce higher quality code, be more productive, and engage with the wider community.
