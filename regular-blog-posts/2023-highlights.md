## Heavy Lifting

I led/co-led the completion of several substantial code features. I had the opportunity to lead team meetings such as Sprint Retro and Sprint Review and Demo. I gave code deep dives and demos to team members and managers. I mentored an apprentice. 

I was an onsite liason. 

Multi-tenancy and orchestration

I served another year as a DEFNA Board Member. I challenged myself to do more "heavy lifting." I provided website CfP and design process oversight. I influenced the talk program, including an emphasis on DE&I. I recruited an outstanding new board member. 

I helped oversee the DjangoCon US website design by publishing our CfP, working to secure a web design contractor, and taking part in website design meetings. 

I created a talk topic inspiration list that was widely shared among leaders in the Django community, including in the Django News Newsletter, and undoubtedly contributed to the number of DjangoCon US proposals increasing from 158 the year before to 185. 

The list kickstarted a conversation that led to this talk by new Django Fellow Natalia Bidart: "Inside Out: My Journey of Understanding Inclusion." 

I went further in my understanding of our board level location/venue considerations, budget, and contract negotiations. 

I attended DjangoCon US and made the most of the experience. Read my recap. 

In addition to being there as a DEFNA Board member, as an attendee, I made many new comments (including PSF Executive Director, Django Fellow), promoted diversity, and acquired new knowledge.

## Quality and Standards

I did research into Python/Django standards and code quality tools. 

I obtained two new certifications: AWS Cloud Practitioner and CockroachDB external certifications. 

Introduction to Distributed SQL and CockroachDB
Practical First Steps with CockroachDB

I shared my open source experience. 

Best in class open source and inner source governance resources. 

I attended multiple product meetups through Product Ignite and Women in Product. 

I took part in a five-part security challenge and finished around the top 10%. 

## Leadership and Public Speaking

A co-worker and I co-presented about Advent of Code. 

I finished my work year off by giving a DjangoCon US Recap presentation at our monthly departmental meetup. 

I completed a JPMorgan Chase [Women on the Move](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/people/women-on-the-move) Career Development Program. I had the opportunity to attend a number of WoTM and Take It Forward (TIF) events. 

## Visibility

In April 2023, Stanford Engineering featured me in an article about my experience as a Stanford Code in Place student in 2020 and section leader in 2021. The article was used to help promote the 2023 version of the course. I was approached to take part. It was an honor to be profiled. 

I was honored to be asked to be featured in an article by Stanford Engineering about my experience taking part in Stanford Code in Place Python program as a student and section leader. https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/stanford-engineering-offers-free-online-introductory-programming-course

## Giving Back

I obtained Managing Director sponsorship to start a monthly departmental meetup. I worked with tech leads and across teams to execute a highly successful launch and grow it into a fun, sustainable, value-adding event. 

I took part in JPMorgan Chase Global Innovation Week Hackathon with a project in the DE&I category. 

## Travel, Food, and Fun

In December, I took the Los Angeles trip that I've been dreaming of taking for years. 

## Looking Ahead

I plan to attend PyTexas in April. 

A co-worker invited me to teach beginner/intermediate Django. I hope to finish the curriculum in early 2024 and teach multiple sessions throughout the year. 

Empower engineers to produce higher quality code, be more productive, and engage with the wider community.
