### Knowing Which Versions of Python and Django to Include

Unsupported versions of Python and Django no longer receive security patches or new features. It's best to drop unsupported versions and add new, supported versions to your test matrix. 

See the [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page, [Django downloads](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) page, and [What Python version can I use with Django?](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/faq/install/#what-python-version-can-i-use-with-django) section of the Django FAQs for more info.
