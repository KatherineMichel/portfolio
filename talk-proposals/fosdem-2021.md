Track: Python Devroom

## Submission notes

Optional. Any additional information about your proposal. Not for publication. Occasionally reviewers may also use this box to ask you questions.

Key Takeaways (why/how it benefits the audience)

This talk will provide a variety of strategies to make the lives of both maintainer and contributor easier. By removing the friction from the process, maintainers will be able to get more done and contributors will be more easily onboarded. The talk will draw from best practices and will include some of the latest tools and GitHub features available.

## Short Abstract

Required. One or two paragraphs for publication that summarise your presentation.

Pinax is an open-source ecosystem of reusable Django starter projects, apps, and themes for building websites. When developers began building Pinax in 2007, they had fun adding to it, but eventually Pinax had grown to become around 80 projects and apps. Without a strategy in place to make Pinax as easy as possible to maintain, the maintainers began to suffer burnout. I was hired to work on Pinax in the fall of 2017. In my talk, I'll outline the critical problems I've discovered and the solutions I'm implementing to make Pinax healthier and easier to maintain today and in the future. Pinax is a work in progress and I'm interested in sharing what I've learned.
