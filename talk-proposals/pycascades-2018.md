Description
Git workflows are not one size fits all! Let me help you choose the workflow that fits your project. In this talk, we will identify advanced Git workflows, how they work, and the pros and cons of each. We’ll also look at real world workflows, including the Python Developer workflow.

Notes
* Some history of git and workflow
* Identifying well known Git workflows, with an explanation of each:
* GitHub Flow
* A Successful Git Branching Model (gitflow)
* GitLab Flow
* Atlassian Recommended Flow
* We will also look at the Python git workflow choices (taken from dev open-source project docs)
* The major pros and cons of each workflow (ex: long-lived branches versus short-lived branches)
* A Successful Git Branching Model Considered Harmful
* SemVer
* Notable workflow choices from each workflow and from organizations that have publicized their workflows (ex. BBC, jQuery, Google, Red Hat, etc.)
* Will include explanation of some of the important Git/GitHub functionality (ex. tags, releases, change logs, merge and patch)
