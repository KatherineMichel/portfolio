Title: Bringing Pinax Back to Life


Topic summary:
Project health and sustainability: What strategies have you used to make the lives of both maintainer and contributor easier in order to sustain a project?


Key Takeaways (why/how it benefits the Maintainers Summit audience)
This talk will provide a variety of strategies to make the lives of both maintainer and contributor easier. By removing the friction from the process, maintainers will be able to get more done and contributors will be more easily onboarded. The talk will draw from best practices and will include some of the latest tools and GitHub features available.


Outline of the main talking points


Critical problems:
* Tribal knowledge
* Existing documentation difficult to find, duplicated, and inconsistent
* Variation in configurations
* Tasks being done manually that could be automated
* Lack of engagement with individuals
* Lack of engagement with the community


Solutions:
* Document the tribal knowledge
* Make one source of documentation, make it extremely easy to find, and use
* Choose one configuration approach and implement across projects
* Automate more tasks
* Reduce the backlog of existing issues and PRs and catchup on engaging with current issues and PRs; give proper credit
* Write more blog posts about plans and progress, and publicize well


Abstract


Pinax is an open-source ecosystem of reusable Django starter projects, apps, and themes for building websites. When developers began building Pinax in 2007, they had fun adding to it, but eventually Pinax had grown to become around 80 projects and apps. Without a strategy in place to make Pinax as easy as possible to maintain, the maintainers began to suffer burnout. I was hired to work on Pinax in the fall of 2017. In my talk, I'll outline the critical problems I've discovered and the solutions I'm implementing to make Pinax healthier and easier to maintain today and in the future. Pinax is a work in progress and I'm interested in sharing what I've learned and finding out what has worked for other people too.
